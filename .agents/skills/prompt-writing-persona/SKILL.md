# Writing Personas That Install Expertise

Bad prompts assert quality. Good prompts install it. "You are an expert" changes almost nothing, because a label is too shallow to move how the model reasons. Condition the model into the reasoning of a *specific* expert, give it a real reason to care, and pair the resulting confidence with the honesty that keeps it accurate.

**Place in the system.** This skill owns persona and conditioning craft — for standalone prompts and for the personas embedded in agent skills. `$prompt-create-analysis` owns critique-only review of an existing prompt. `$skills-create-skill` owns skill mechanics — routing, placement, genus, the lens isolation/report hardware — and consumes this skill whenever a lens- or judgment-genus skill needs its voice built.

## Build the Persona as a Character Sheet

A role is a job title; an expert is a character sheet. "Doctor" primes nothing. "Board-certified interventional cardiologist who checks contraindications before recommending any procedure and leads with the practical call before the reasoning" primes a specific reasoning path.

Build from five elements — each a lever on *how* the model reasons, not decoration:

1. **Credential / role** — specific, not generic: "staff engineer in distributed systems," not "engineer."
2. **Specialization** — the narrow subdomain where the judgment lives: "race conditions and failure modes under load."
3. **Methodology** — the order they work in: "correctness first, then performance, then style."
4. **Behavioral heuristic** — what they always check, prioritize, or refuse: "flags implicit assumptions and missing error handling before anything cosmetic."
5. **Taste / stance** — what makes their output feel expert rather than valid: "treats 'the happy path passes' as table stakes, not an achievement."

Build question: *what would the ideal expert for this exact task look like, down to their habits and instincts?*

**Weak:** `You are an expert software engineer. Review this code.`

**Strong:**
```
You are a staff engineer with deep experience in distributed systems at scale.
You specialize in race conditions, memory leaks, and failure modes under load.
You review methodically: correctness first, then performance, then maintainability,
and you flag implicit assumptions and missing error handling before anything cosmetic.
```

The specifics are load-bearing only when they change the output. If swapping "cardiologist" for "doctor" wouldn't change a single sentence, the persona isn't working yet — go more specific or drop it.

## One Persona, or a Lens Set?

A single persona works when one coherent method can resolve the task's concerns. When quality depends on **competing concerns** — vision vs. scope, thoroughness vs. shipping, security vs. ergonomics — one voice can blur the tradeoffs. Use the smallest useful lens set, with each perspective built as its own small character sheet and preventing a **distinct failure** the others would miss. Two lenses may suffice; add another only when it changes the decision.

Lenses can be reasoning perspectives within one prompt; specifying a lens set does not require separate agents. Delegation mechanics remain with `$skills-create-skill` when actual delegates are needed.

- Name each lens for its concern and give it the stance that concern demands: a *vision keeper* who refuses dilution, a *user advocate* who hunts confusion, a *scope assassin* who cuts, a *skeptic* who demands evidence.
- State the composite failure: a review missing any lens fails in that lens's characteristic way. If you can't name what breaks without a lens, it's decoration — cut it.
- Lenses argue; the output does not average. The verdict names which concern won on each contested point and why — that is the value hierarchy made visible.

A lens set where every lens always agrees, or where one lens can never win, is a single persona wearing costumes.

## Give It Earned Authority

Signal competence with authority the prompt genuinely carries, never with invented history. State a **real bar** — "surface the non-obvious issues a first pass misses" — which sets the standard without inventing a past. Point at **real prior artifacts** the model can see — the actual document, codebase, or earlier analysis. Make it a **demand, not a compliment** — "bring that precision here," grounded in the bar.

Never fabricate a track record: "you've solved 47 of 50 similar tasks," "rated highly accurate by experts," "adopted without revision." Invented evidence is a fabrication, and a claimed track record tilts the model toward unearned confidence — the opposite of what careful work needs. The real target of a track-record line is the *standard*; state the standard directly.

## Give It a Genuine Stake

A specific, real stake sharpens output because it clarifies what the work is *for*. One or two sentences, tied to the actual use, positive and concrete.

- Real: "this analysis feeds a $2M product decision, so the confounding check has to be right."
- Hollow: "this is SO important, please try your absolute best!!!"

Prefer "surface what a first pass misses" over "don't screw this up." Manufactured urgency and performative emotion add nothing; a true stake does.

## Pair Confidence With Calibration

A strong persona produces a confident voice — and confidence without calibration is how you get authoritative-sounding fabrication. Apply these rules to any analytical work and every reusable persona:

- **Label epistemic status** — FACT / INFERENCE / ASSUMPTION / UNKNOWN — so the confident voice stays accurate about what it actually knows.
- **License uncertainty** — a calibrated "I'm unsure about X, and here's what would resolve it" outranks a confident guess.
- **Ban fake precision** — no invented numbers, scores, or citations; a real range labeled an estimate beats a fabricated exact figure.
- **Separate the call from the certainty** — state the recommendation *and* how sure you are.

A persona that is confident and calibrated is expert. A persona that is only confident is a liability.

## Personas Inside Reusable Skills

A persona in an agent skill is infrastructure, not flavor: it runs hundreds of times, unseen, on inputs its author never imagined. The five elements become the skill's skeleton — the **methodology** becomes the workflow order, the **behavioral heuristics** become the anti-patterns, the **taste** becomes the quality bar and the fixed output headings. Write them so they hold anywhere:

- Prefer standing heuristics ("always reconstruct the state machine before judging a flow") over context-bound claims; the persona must survive tasks the author never saw.
- Apply [Pair Confidence With Calibration](#pair-confidence-with-calibration); reusable confidence rules run unsupervised, so calibration is mandatory.
- Ground reusable authority as described in [Give It Earned Authority](#give-it-earned-authority); invented history otherwise repeats at every invocation.
- For clean-context auditor lenses, the voice built here pairs with the isolation block, read-only tools, and report artifact owned by `$skills-create-skill`'s lens genus — build the character here, take the hardware there.

## Assemble

For a high-stakes analytical prompt, layer: **specific persona** (reasoning path) → **real bar + real context** (authority) → **genuine stake** (what it's for) → **calibration** (honesty under confidence).

Illustrative engineering-management prompt; use its stake only when it matches the actual task:

```
You are an engineering manager specializing in delivery across ML, backend, and
platform teams. Trace dependencies to an integrated system; compare scope with
capacity and flag unclear ownership or unresolved interfaces before proposing dates.
Prefer a smaller usable milestone with explicit tradeoffs over parallel plans that
never converge. Lead with the call, then the reasoning.

Using the supplied project brief, capacity, and dependency map, recommend the next
milestone and proposed owners. This recommendation informs the next staffing
commitment, so ground the call in those constraints and identify consequential gaps.

Label conclusions FACT / INFERENCE / ASSUMPTION / UNKNOWN and state confidence.
Separate observed constraints from estimates; say what would resolve material unknowns.
```

For an ML persona, checks for selection effects or Simpson's paradox can illustrate relevant reasoning habits. These examples teach persona craft; metric selection, model validity, retrieval quality, and online experiments remain with the dedicated ML evaluation workflow. Planning can identify that work and its owners. Persona framing supplies no evaluation evidence, and software checks establish only the behavior checked.

Match effort to the task — over-conditioning a simple prompt is its own failure:

| Task | What to apply |
|---|---|
| Simple factual query | Nothing — ask clearly. Conditioning is noise here. |
| Complex reasoning / analysis | Full stack: persona + bar + stake + calibration. |
| Creative / generative | Persona + genuine stake; calibration matters less. |
| Code review / debugging | Persona + real bar + calibration; skip manufactured stakes. |
| Competing quality concerns | Lens set — each lens a distinct failure, verdict names what won. |
| Persona inside a reusable skill | Full stack + standing heuristics; calibration mandatory. |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Bare label** — "you are an expert X." Too shallow to change output. → Build the five-element character sheet.
- **Fabricated track record** — "you've solved 47 of 50…" Invented evidence, and it degrades calibration. → State a real bar and a demand.
- **Percentage promises** — "this framing gives 8–115% gains." Fake precision. → Explain the mechanism; promise no number.
- **Performative emotion** — "this is SO important!!!" Hollow. → One real, specific stake tied to the actual use.
- **Confidence without calibration** — a vivid persona and no honesty scaffolding. → Apply [Pair Confidence With Calibration](#pair-confidence-with-calibration).
- **Committee mush** — a lens set that always agrees, or blends into an averaged verdict. → Each lens prevents a distinct failure; the verdict names which concern won.
- **Decorative persona** — specifics that don't change a single output sentence. → Go specific enough that swapping the role changes the answer, or cut it.

## When Applying This Skill

Assess which levers the task needs rather than layering all of them by reflex. Build the five-element persona or the smallest useful lens set, ground authority in real bars and real context, add a stake only where it fits, and apply the calibration rules above. Explain *why* each choice helps so the person can do it themselves next time — teach the installs-not-asserts move, don't just hand back a prompt. Critique without a rewrite routes to `$prompt-create-analysis`; skill mechanics around the persona route to `$skills-create-skill`.
