name: code-threejs-rapier-performance
description: Enforces deterministic, measurement-driven mobile-web performance architecture for Three.js + Rapier before code or asset changes, covering render and physics budgets, frame stability, loading/streaming, memory, quality tiers, off-main-thread decisions, and proof via observability. Use for any change touching Three.js, Rapier, WebXR/WebGL/WebGPU rendering, shaders, scene graph, cameras, controls, physics, colliders/controllers, glTF/KTX2/meshopt assets, or fps, jank, stutter, and load-time issues.
---

Before writing code or changing assets, adopt this as law.

Mobile-web performance is not “higher FPS.” It is stable frame time, low touch/input latency, bounded memory, controlled download size, thermal resilience, and deterministic simulation on real phones. The goal is not to make one device look impressive. The goal is to ship a game that feels responsive, stays correct, and degrades intentionally across mobile browsers.

Stop and rethink if you cannot say what work is being **removed**, **simplified**, **delayed**, or **moved off the hot path**.

---

# 1) Non-Negotiables (mobile-web constitution)

## 1.1 Measure before prescribing
- Never optimize from vibes.
- Separate these failure classes before suggesting fixes:
  - frame-rate collapse
  - touch/input lag
  - load/streaming stall
  - memory/VRAM pressure
  - thermal degradation over time
  - deterministic divergence
- If evidence is thin, say so and define the first measurement that would settle it.

## 1.2 Remove work before optimizing work
The first question is never “how do we make this faster?”  
The first question is “what work can the player stop paying for?”

Priority order:
1. **Eliminate work** we do not need.
2. **Reduce frequency** of work that remains.
3. **Reduce scope** of work to only what the player can perceive or affect.
4. **Move work** off the hot path or off the main thread.
5. **Tune** the remaining work.
6. **Micro-optimize code** last.

## 1.3 Mobile-first, not desktop-excused
- Assume fill-rate, thermal headroom, memory, and main-thread time are tight.
- Optimize for the weakest supported mobile class, not the development laptop.
- Treat battery and long-session stability as product quality, not polish.

## 1.4 Determinism is law
- Authoritative gameplay must use a fixed simulation step.
- Gameplay must not depend on render framerate.
- Low/Medium/High may change presentation, density, shadows, particles, post, and resolution; they must not change authoritative outcomes, replay hashes, or simulation semantics.
- Never introduce a second timing model, second physics path, or “almost deterministic” fallback.

## 1.5 One clear way
- Reuse existing repo systems for tiers, capability scoring, render abstraction, determinism guards, asset pipelines, resource tracking, and perf counters.
- Do not invent a second device classifier, second quality system, or second cleanup pattern unless you are deleting the first one in the same change or executing a migration plan.

## 1.6 Solve the exact problem
- No drive-by refactors.
- No unrelated visual redesign.
- No “optimization” that quietly changes gameplay, control feel, camera semantics, or replay correctness.

---

# 2) Domain Rules

## 2.1 Game-form specialization is mandatory
Before choosing tactics, classify the game. Different games can afford different degradations.

Required axes:
- **Visibility pattern:** room / arena / corridor / open / streamed
- **Camera:** first-person / third-person / top-down / side-view / other
- **Interaction density:** low / medium / high
- **Physics criticality:** authoritative / hybrid / cosmetic
- **Readability priority:** silhouettes / depth cues / hit timing / spatial precision / camera comfort

Examples:
- **Corridor racer / runner:** spend detail near the forward path; aggressively reduce side/rear detail, far shadows, and off-route collisions.
- **Arena brawler / top-down shooter:** preserve input clarity, hit readability, and enemy silhouettes first; degrade particles, shadows, decals, and distant props before core readability.
- **Physics puzzler:** keep interactive bodies and contact behavior correct; degrade decorative rendering before solver accuracy on puzzle-critical bodies.
- **Builder / sim / open view:** prioritize batching, culling, LOD, and streaming discipline; the camera can expose huge surface area, so scene-structure choices dominate.

Every recommendation must tie back to this classification.

## 2.2 Performance is a budget stack, not a single number
Always reason in separate budgets:
- **Frame budget**
- **Interaction budget**
- **Memory / VRAM budget**
- **Load / streaming budget**
- **Thermal / soak budget**
- **Determinism budget** (what timing or ordering changes are disallowed)

Never use FPS alone as proof.

Use this bottleneck cheat sheet:

- **Fill-rate / overdraw bound:** FPS improves when internal resolution drops; draw calls stay similar.
- **CPU draw-call / scene traversal bound:** FPS barely changes with internal resolution; draw calls, state changes, or traversal cost are high.
- **Shader/material/post bound:** a few full-screen or expensive materials dominate; simplifying materials or passes helps more than geometry changes.
- **Physics bound:** physics step time grows with active bodies, contacts, joints, CCD, or queries; render simplification barely moves the needle.
- **Main-thread bound:** long tasks, input lag, or GC spikes dominate; worker moves or allocation cleanup help.
- **Memory/VRAM bound:** hitching, evictions, crashes, or degraded stability increase with scene churn, texture count, or render-target use.
- **Load/decode bound:** boot or streaming stalls dominate; compression, smaller assets, and off-main-thread decode matter most.

## 2.3 Asset & content pipeline is part of runtime performance
A mobile-web perf pass is incomplete without an asset audit.

Required asset principles:
- Prefer a real glTF pipeline over ad hoc runtime content.
- Use compressed textures where the pipeline supports them.
- Use geometry compression / quantization where the pipeline supports them.
- Instance repeated props whenever material and geometry allow it.
- Batch repeated geometry sharing a material when instancing is not enough.
- Reduce unique materials; material diversity becomes draw-call diversity.
- Use LODs for repeated or distant content.
- Treat transparency as a budgeted exception, not a default art style.
- Texture dimensions are chosen by on-screen need, not by source art size.
- Animation data is budgeted too: skeleton count, clip count, update frequency, and resampling/compression matter.
- Streaming and disposal are first-class. Loaded once forever is not a valid default for large mobile scenes.

For any meaningful content change, explicitly answer:
- What became smaller?
- What became fewer?
- What became shared?
- What became streamable?
- What gets disposed when no longer needed?

## 2.4 Rendering constitution (Three.js on mobile)
### 2.4.1 Default shipping mindset
Default to **WebGL-first shipping constraints**.  
You may evaluate `WebGPURenderer`, but only adopt it when:
- the gain is material,
- the fallback story is explicit,
- and the features used do not quietly trap us on a path we cannot ship broadly.

If you use `WebGPURenderer`, say whether the feature set remains compatible with the fallback backend. If not, say so plainly and gate it intentionally.

### 2.4.2 Internal resolution is a control loop
Never blindly render heavy mobile scenes at full device pixel ratio.

Use explicit internal resolution policy:
- CSS controls display size.
- Rendering code controls drawing-buffer size.
- Cap total internal pixel count.
- Support dynamic render scale when needed.
- Know the actual buffer size being rendered, especially if postprocessing, picking, screenshots, or pixel-based shaders exist.

Example:
```ts
function computeInternalSize(cssWidth: number, cssHeight: number, dpr: number, maxPixels: number) {
  let width = Math.floor(cssWidth * dpr);
  let height = Math.floor(cssHeight * dpr);
  const scale = Math.min(1, Math.sqrt(maxPixels / (width * height)));
  width = Math.floor(width * scale);
  height = Math.floor(height * scale);
  return { width, height };
}
````

### 2.4.3 Every pixel is a budget item

Treat these as explicitly budgeted, never “free”:

* expensive materials
* transmission/refraction-like effects
* transparency and overdraw
* bloom / SSAO / SSR / SSGI / other post passes
* dynamic shadows
* high sample counts / MSAA choices
* large render targets
* readbacks (`readPixels`, screenshots, picking paths)
* preserve-drawing-buffer style requirements
* logarithmic-depth or other features that alter early-depth behavior

Prefer:

* cheaper materials for non-hero assets
* opaque over transparent
* front-to-back opaque ordering when possible
* baked / static / highly selective dynamic shadows
* fewer full-screen passes
* one strong visual idea over many medium-cost effects

### 2.4.4 Draw calls and scene submission are first-class costs

* Repeated props should be **InstancedMesh**, **BatchedMesh**, merged geometry, or another deliberate batching strategy.
* Static worlds should not pay dynamic update costs every frame.
* Visibility should be constrained by frustum, distance, room/sector/portal/corridor logic, and content-specific rules.
* Do not keep thousands of individually updated objects if the player perceives them as one population.

### 2.4.5 GPU lifecycle is explicit

* Removing an object from the scene is not enough.
* Geometry, material, texture, and render-target ownership must be explicit.
* Scene churn must have a disposal plan.
* Streaming in/out must not leak GPU resources.

## 2.5 Physics constitution (Rapier on mobile)

### 2.5.1 Fixed-step only

* Use a fixed authoritative timestep.
* Never tie authoritative gameplay to variable frame delta.
* If render interpolation exists, keep it presentation-only.

### 2.5.2 Use real units

* Use SI-style physics units and an explicit render↔physics scale.
* Never use pixels as Rapier length units.
* State the mapping clearly, e.g. `1 physics meter = 50 render pixels` or the 3D equivalent.

### 2.5.3 Prefer the cheapest body model that preserves gameplay

Choose the simplest valid body type:

* fixed before kinematic
* kinematic before dynamic
* character controller before full rigid-body dynamics when gameplay wants authored movement rather than emergent simulation

### 2.5.4 Collider choice is a performance choice

* Prefer primitive or compound colliders where possible.
* Use convex approximations when exact mesh collision is unnecessary.
* Avoid dynamic triangle-mesh colliders unless there is a compelling, measured reason.
* Be explicit about why a collider shape is worth its cost.

### 2.5.5 Simulate fewer things

* Sleeping should be enabled wherever gameplay allows.
* Collision groups should remove unnecessary interactions early.
* Query filters should exclude irrelevant colliders from raycasts/shape-casts.
* Solver groups are not a substitute for removing broad collision work.
* CCD is for bodies with genuine tunneling risk, not a blanket safety switch.
* Contact events, force events, and physics hooks are budgeted features; enable only where gameplay consumes them.

### 2.5.6 Physics cost is mostly scene architecture

Do not start by tweaking solver iterations. Start here:

1. Fewer active bodies
2. Fewer collider pairs
3. Simpler collider shapes
4. Fewer joints
5. Narrower CCD scope
6. Narrower event/query scope
7. Only then: solver and integration tuning

### 2.5.7 JS↔WASM boundary is part of the hot path

* Minimize per-body round trips each tick.
* Prefer structured sync points over ad hoc reads everywhere.
* If only a subset of bodies moved, do not blindly resync every body.
* Explicitly state how rendering gets transforms from Rapier and how much data crosses that boundary per frame.
* Dispose of WASM-backed resources when their lifecycle ends.

### 2.5.8 Scene-query discipline

If a feature only needs raycasts, shape-casts, or overlap tests, justify why full body dynamics or full-scene queries without filtering are necessary. Use filters aggressively.

## 2.6 Threading & browser constitution

### 2.6.1 Off-main-thread evaluation is mandatory

For every meaningful change, explicitly evaluate whether work belongs off the main thread:

* rendering via OffscreenCanvas
* asset parse/decode/transcode
* scene preparation
* physics or other heavy systems
* background warmup/precompute

The final answer may still keep work on the main thread, but only with a reasoned justification.

### 2.6.2 Main-thread time is for responsiveness

* Input, DOM, and critical UI must remain responsive.
* Avoid blocking the main thread with asset parse/transcode, heavy scene construction, or bulk data transforms if a worker path is feasible.
* Avoid layout or DOM work in the frame loop unless absolutely necessary.

### 2.6.3 Cross-thread design must name costs

If using workers:

* define ownership,
* define message frequency and payload shape,
* define what happens on startup, resize, pause/resume, and context loss,
* define fallback if worker/offscreen support is unavailable or not worth the complexity.

## 2.7 Quality tiers & device auto-select constitution

We ship exactly **three** presets:

* **Low**
* **Medium**
* **High**

Rules:

* Auto-select uses the repo’s existing capability heuristic if one exists.
* User override must be available and persistent.
* Tiers change presentation, not deterministic gameplay.
* Tiering must be data-driven and centralized, not scattered across files.

Each tier must specify exact knobs such as:

* render scale / max pixel count
* shadow mode
* postprocessing enablement
* texture/anisotropy budget
* LOD distances / bias
* vegetation / crowd / decal / particle density
* reflection / transmission / transparency budget
* non-authoritative physics FX density
* far-scene visibility budget

Example:

```ts
const qualityTiers = {
  low: {
    maxPixels: 1280 * 720,
    shadows: "off",
    post: "off",
    anisotropy: 1,
    lodBias: 2,
    densityScale: 0.5,
    particleScale: 0.4,
    nonAuthoritativeFx: "reduced",
  },
  medium: {
    maxPixels: 1920 * 1080,
    shadows: "selective",
    post: "minimal",
    anisotropy: 2,
    lodBias: 1,
    densityScale: 0.75,
    particleScale: 0.7,
    nonAuthoritativeFx: "standard",
  },
  high: {
    maxPixels: 2560 * 1440,
    shadows: "budgeted",
    post: "selective",
    anisotropy: 4,
    lodBias: 0,
    densityScale: 1,
    particleScale: 1,
    nonAuthoritativeFx: "full",
  },
};
```

Bad tiering:

* “Low” changes hitboxes, simulation rate, or authoritative collision.
* “High” silently enables a different gameplay path.
* Device auto-select cannot be overridden.
* Heuristics live in multiple unrelated places.

## 2.8 Observability constitution

We do not trust optimization we cannot observe.

Minimum instrumentation:

* frame time histogram
* long tasks / jank indicators
* interaction latency signals
* draw calls / triangles / texture count / render-target count
* active body / collider / joint / contact / query counts
* physics step time
* load/stream timings
* memory growth across scene churn
* current quality tier and any automatic downgrades/upgrades

Logs should explain **why** the engine changed tier or disabled a feature.
Do not spam per-frame logs on hot paths.

## 2.9 Testing constitution

### 2.9.1 Required tests

* Every meaningful behavior change includes at least **one deterministic integration test**.
* Every bug fix begins with a failing deterministic regression test.
* Every hot-path change includes a benchmark, profile, or perf regression test.
* Every tier-system change includes a deterministic tier-selection test.
* Every fallback-capability change includes a fallback-path test.

### 2.9.2 Determinism test example

```ts
it("replays the same inputs to the same authoritative snapshot", () => {
  const resultA = runReplay({ seed: 42, inputs });
  const resultB = runReplay({ seed: 42, inputs });

  expect(resultA.snapshotHash).toBe(resultB.snapshotHash);
  expect(resultA.authoritativeEvents).toEqual(resultB.authoritativeEvents);
});
```

### 2.9.3 Anti-flake rules

* No sleeps for correctness.
* Fixed time / fixed seeds.
* Bounded waits.
* Hermetic tests.
* Real serialization and real async boundaries where the bug or perf risk lives.

## 2.10 Migration constitution

If you change:

* asset formats,
* tier settings,
* renderer path,
* feature flags,
* capability detection,
* or scene/physics interfaces,

use **Expand → Migrate → Contract**.

No permanent dual systems.
No orphaned legacy tier knobs.
No second renderer or second device scorer without a deletion plan.

---

# 3) Mobile-Web Anti-Patterns (banned unless justified + measured)

* Blindly calling `renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio)` for a heavy mobile scene.
* Assuming full-DPR rendering is the default for phones.
* Using expensive materials broadly when a cheaper material preserves gameplay readability.
* Treating transparency, bloom, SSAO/SSR/SSGI, or dynamic shadows as free polish.
* Shipping repeated props as thousands of separate draw calls when instancing or batching is available.
* Updating huge static scene graphs every frame.
* Using pixels as Rapier world units.
* Enabling CCD broadly “just to be safe.”
* Emitting collision/contact/query events for systems that do not consume them.
* Running scene queries against everything without filter groups.
* Syncing every physics body from WASM to JS every tick without proving it is necessary.
* Allocating vectors, matrices, arrays, strings, or closures in hot loops.
* Parsing, transcoding, or constructing large scenes on the main thread without evaluating worker/offscreen alternatives.
* Forgetting disposal for geometries, materials, textures, render targets, or WASM-backed objects.
* Creating a second tier system, second capability scorer, second cleanup pattern, or second determinism model instead of reusing the repo’s standard path.
* Claiming a perf win without before/after evidence or a falsifiable cost model.
* Quietly changing authoritative gameplay semantics under the banner of optimization.

---

# 4) Implementation Rules

## 4.1 Centralize performance knobs

* Tier knobs live in one clear config surface.
* Renderer, physics, streaming, and content systems read from the same tier intent.
* No scattered magic numbers.

## 4.2 Name the budget in the code

* Use names with units and intent: `maxPixels`, `physicsStepHz`, `shadowDistanceMeters`, `tierAutoSelectScore`, `maxBodiesForFx`.
* Make it obvious which knobs are presentation-only and which are authoritative.

## 4.3 Prefer data-driven simplification over clever engine tricks

* Small, explicit, reviewable changes beat opaque “smart” systems.
* LLM-generated code should be able to follow the path mechanically: centralized config, explicit ownership, clear tier tables, narrow helpers.

## 4.4 Lifecycle is explicit

* Anything that allocates GPU or WASM resources must have a cleanup path.
* Anything async must be cancellable or safely ignorable on teardown.
* Scene churn must not retain stale references.

## 4.5 Hot-path hygiene

* Reuse temp objects where it materially reduces churn.
* Avoid hidden allocations in frame loops.
* Avoid repeated string work, object spreads, and closure churn on hot paths.
* Keep the render/update loop boring.

# 6) What “excellent” looks like

Excellent changes are boring in the best way:

* the player-facing priority is explicit
* unnecessary work disappears
* the bottleneck is named before the fix is proposed
* render, physics, and browser-main-thread costs are handled separately
* quality tiers are deliberate, data-driven, and overrideable
* deterministic gameplay remains identical across tiers
* memory stays bounded through load/unload churn
* performance claims are measured, not narrated
* the code path gets simpler, not more magical
