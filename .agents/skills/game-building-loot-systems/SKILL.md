# Game Loot & Reward Systems Skill (JavaScript)

You make kills feel like slot machines and pickups feel like Christmas morning.  
You think in feedback loops, probability distributions, and dopamine curves. You bring three lenses to every loot problem:
* The mathematician — expected values, geometric distributions, pseudo-random correction, system dynamics. You know that a 1% drop rate means 13% of players see 200+ dry kills, and you design around that before anyone has to complain.
* The psychologist — variable-ratio reinforcement, loss aversion, near-miss energy, compressed anticipation. You know why the gacha pull animation exists and when that technique serves the player vs. exploits them.
* The craftsperson — does the coin vacuum feel satisfying at minute 5? Does the legendary drop still hit at hour 20? Does the economy hold at week 6? If you haven't playtested the feel at three timescales, you haven't finished designing.
If any lens is missing, the system breaks: math without psychology produces correct but joyless tables. Psychology without math produces manipulative systems that collapse under scrutiny. Either without craft produces something that reads well in a GDD and dies on contact with a real player session.
Your job: given a game's core loop, design the reward layer so that effort feels recognized, randomness feels fair, and the next drop always feels possible.

**The three subsystems of loot (never conflate them):**
- **Selection** — *what* drops and *when* (tables, weights, pity math)
- **Generation** — *what the item is* (stats, affixes, parts, rarity properties)
- **Presentation** — *how the player experiences it* (physics, fanfare, reveal, UI)

A broken Selection system drops the wrong things. A broken Generation system makes items feel samey. A broken Presentation system makes good drops feel like nothing. **All three must work.**

Your mantra: **Kill thing → get thing → feel good** — and feel good *proportionally* to how rare/powerful the thing is.

## Prime Directives

### 1) Loot is information, not just reward
Every drop teaches the player something: what this enemy can give, how close they are to power thresholds, what's possible in this game. If the player can't learn the system's patterns — even subconsciously — the system fails regardless of how generous it is.

### 2) Pure randomness feels unfair — always shape it
Humans expect random sequences to have fewer streaks than they actually do. A 5% drop rate means 36% of players will go 20+ kills dry. **Every rare drop needs streak protection.** This is not optional.

### 3) Presentation is functional, not decorative
The visual/physical/temporal experience of receiving loot is part of the reward mechanism. A legendary that appears as a text popup and a legendary that freezes the world, glows, bounces heavy, and reveals with fanfare produce *different amounts of dopamine* from the same item. Presentation multiplies the value of good Selection and Generation.

### 4) Design the upgrade cadence, not the drop rate
Start with: "How many minutes of play between moments that feel exciting?" Work backward to rates. Never start with arbitrary percentages and hope the timing works out.

### 5) Inflow must balance outflow
Drop rates in isolation are meaningless. Items enter through drops and leave through selling, recycling, obsolescence, and inventory limits. If inflow > outflow, loot becomes meaningless. If inflow < outflow, players feel starved. Diagnose the economy before tuning tables.

---

## Required Workflow

### Pass 0 — Diagnose the Reward Loop
Before implementing anything, state:
- What is the **core loop**? (kill → loot → equip → kill harder)
- What **motivates** this game's player? (power acquisition / collection / build-crafting / social status)
- What is the **desired upgrade cadence**? (exciting drop every ~N minutes)
- What is the **economy shape**? (where do items enter, where do they leave)
- What **genre defaults** apply? (see Genre Presets below)

### Pass 1 — Selection System (what drops)
Design drop tables, rarity weights, pity mechanics, and context-aware filtering.

### Pass 2 — Generation System (what the item is)
Design item templates, stat ranges, affix pools, and procedural assembly.

### Pass 3 — Presentation System (how it feels)
Design pickup physics, reveal choreography, fanfare scaling, and UI updates.

### Pass 4 — Simulation & Validation
Produce test code that rolls N times and reports: distribution accuracy, worst-case streaks, pity trigger frequency, upgrade cadence match.

### Pass 5 — Guardrails & Edge Cases
Handle: empty table fallbacks, inventory overflow, pity persistence across sessions, multiplayer loot modes, extreme grind scenarios.

## The Rarity Ladder (Scales Everything)

Define rarity tiers and use them to scale **all** parameters consistently. Suggested defaults (tune to your game):

| Tier | Color | Base Rate | Pity Threshold | Stat Quality | Physics Weight | Fanfare Duration |
|------|-------|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| Common | White/Gray | 60–75% | — | floor–30% | light bounce, fast magnet | instant snap |
| Uncommon | Green | 20–30% | — | 20–50% | medium bounce | 100ms pop |
| Rare | Blue | 8–15% | 20–30 rolls | 40–70% | heavier, slower settle | 250ms sequence |
| Epic | Purple | 2–5% | 40–60 rolls | 65–90% | dramatic arc, slow bounce | 500ms choreography |
| Legendary | Gold/Orange | 0.5–1.5% | 60–100 rolls | 85–100% | heavy thud, long settle | 800ms+ full fanfare |

**Rule:** Every parameter in the system should be indexable by rarity tier. If you're writing a `switch` on rarity, it should cover all three subsystems.

---

## SUBSYSTEM 1: SELECTION (What Drops and When)

### Architecture: Hierarchical Tables (Default)

Two-phase roll: pick rarity tier → pick item within tier. Tuning is per-tier, not per-item.

```js
// --- Data Structure ---
const dropTable = {
  id: 'skeleton_warrior',
  nothingWeight: 30,        // chance of no drop at all
  tiers: [
    { rarity: 'common',    weight: 50, items: ['bone', 'cloth', 'coin_small'] },
    { rarity: 'uncommon',  weight: 15, items: ['iron_sword', 'leather_helm'] },
    { rarity: 'rare',      weight: 4,  items: ['enchanted_blade', 'skull_ring'] },
    { rarity: 'epic',      weight: 0.8, items: ['shadow_cleaver'] },
    { rarity: 'legendary', weight: 0.2, items: ['lich_king_crown'] },
  ],
};

// --- Weighted Selection (O(n), fine for ≤50 entries) ---
function weightedPick(entries) {
  // entries: [{ value, weight }, ...]
  let total = 0;
  for (const e of entries) total += e.weight;
  let roll = Math.random() * total;
  for (const e of entries) {
    roll -= e.weight;
    if (roll <= 0) return e.value;
  }
  return entries[entries.length - 1].value; // float safety
}

// --- Two-Phase Roll ---
function rollDrop(table) {
  // Phase 1: drop or nothing?
  const allWeight = table.nothingWeight + table.tiers.reduce((s, t) => s + t.weight, 0);
  const nothingChance = table.nothingWeight / allWeight;
  if (Math.random() < nothingChance) return null;

  // Phase 2: pick rarity tier
  const tier = weightedPick(table.tiers.map(t => ({ value: t, weight: t.weight })));

  // Phase 3: pick item within tier (uniform, or weighted if items have individual weights)
  const item = tier.items[Math.floor(Math.random() * tier.items.length)];

  return { rarity: tier.rarity, itemId: item };
}
```

**For large item pools (100+):** use Walker's Alias Method for O(1) selection after O(n) setup.

### Context-Aware Filtering (Smart Loot)

Before rolling, filter the eligible pool:

```js
function getEligibleItems(tier, context) {
  return tier.items.filter(item => {
    const def = itemDefs[item];
    if (def.minLevel && context.playerLevel < def.minLevel) return false;
    if (def.class && context.playerClass !== def.class && !context.smartLootDisabled) return false;
    if (context.recentDrops?.includes(item)) return false; // anti-repeat
    return true;
  });
}
```

**Tradeoff:** Smart loot prevents "garbage floods" but reduces discovery serendipity. Hades solution: bias the *offered choices*, not the outcome — present 3 smart-filtered options and let the player pick.

### Pseudo-Random Distribution (PRD) — Streak Protection

Pure RNG with a 5% chance means ~13% of players go 50+ attempts without a hit. PRD reshapes the distribution: low initial probability that increases per miss, resetting on hit. Average rate stays the same; variance drops dramatically.

```js
// --- PRD Implementation ---

// Compute C-value (initial probability) for a desired nominal rate P.
// Uses Newton-Raphson approximation. Pre-compute for your rates.
function computePRD_C(P) {
  // Approximate: C ≈ P for P < 0.05; iterate for precision
  let c = P;
  for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    const expected = prdExpectedValue(c);
    const delta = P - (1 / expected);
    c += delta * 0.5;
    c = Math.max(0.001, Math.min(P, c));
  }
  return c;
}

function prdExpectedValue(c) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let n = 1; n <= Math.ceil(1 / c); n++) {
    const prob = Math.min(1, n * c);
    let pReachN = 1;
    for (let k = 1; k < n; k++) pReachN *= (1 - Math.min(1, k * c));
    sum += n * prob * pReachN;
  }
  return sum;
}

// Pre-computed C-values for common rates:
const PRD_C = {
  0.05: 0.00380,  // 5% nominal
  0.10: 0.01475,  // 10%
  0.15: 0.03221,  // 15%
  0.25: 0.07501,  // 25%
};

// --- Usage: PRD-backed drop check ---
const prdState = { failCount: 0 };

function prdCheck(nominalRate, state) {
  const c = PRD_C[nominalRate] ?? computePRD_C(nominalRate);
  state.failCount++;
  const p = Math.min(1, c * state.failCount);
  if (Math.random() < p) {
    state.failCount = 0;
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

**When to use PRD:** any drop/proc rate where a dry streak would cause frustration — typically rates below ~30%. For very rare drops (≤2%), combine PRD with a hard pity ceiling.

### Pity Systems — Guaranteed Floors

Two patterns, often combined:

```js
// --- Hard Pity: guaranteed at N attempts ---
const pity = { count: 0, hardCeiling: 80 };

function rollWithPity(table, pityState) {
  pityState.count++;
  if (pityState.count >= pityState.hardCeiling) {
    pityState.count = 0;
    return forceRareDrop(table); // guaranteed epic+ drop
  }
  const result = rollDrop(table);
  if (result && isHighRarity(result.rarity)) pityState.count = 0;
  return result;
}

// --- Soft Pity: escalating probability past threshold ---
function softPityRate(baseRate, attempts, softStart, hardCeiling) {
  if (attempts < softStart) return baseRate;
  // Linear ramp from softStart to hardCeiling
  const progress = (attempts - softStart) / (hardCeiling - softStart);
  return baseRate + (1 - baseRate) * Math.min(1, progress);
  // At hardCeiling, rate = 100%
}

// Example: 1% base, soft pity starts at 60, hard ceiling at 80
// At attempt 60: 1%. At attempt 70: ~50%. At attempt 80: 100%.
```

**Soft pity start point:** typically 70–80% of hard ceiling (e.g., soft at 60, hard at 80). This mirrors the Genshin model and is well-tested at scale.

**Persistence:** pity counters MUST save across sessions. Store in save data, not in memory.

### Drop Quantity Scaling

For multi-drop events (boss kills, chests), use a quantity curve:

```js
function rollDropCount(base, bonus, maxDrops) {
  // base: guaranteed minimum (e.g., 2)
  // bonus: each has a % chance of extra drops
  let count = base;
  for (let i = 0; i < maxDrops - base; i++) {
    if (Math.random() < bonus) count++;
    else break; // diminishing: first extra is likely, later extras rare
  }
  return count;
}
```

---

## SUBSYSTEM 2: GENERATION (What the Item Is)

### Item Templates (Simple)

For games with fixed item pools (platformers, roguelikes):

```js
const itemDefs = {
  'iron_sword': {
    name: 'Iron Sword',
    rarity: 'common',
    slot: 'weapon',
    baseStats: { attack: [5, 8] },  // [min, max] — rolled on drop
    icon: 'sword_iron',
  },
  'enchanted_blade': {
    name: 'Enchanted Blade',
    rarity: 'rare',
    slot: 'weapon',
    baseStats: { attack: [12, 18], magic: [5, 10] },
    icon: 'sword_glow',
  },
};

function generateItem(itemId) {
  const def = itemDefs[itemId];
  const item = { id: itemId, ...def, stats: {} };
  for (const [stat, [min, max]] of Object.entries(def.baseStats)) {
    item.stats[stat] = rollStat(min, max, def.rarity);
  }
  return item;
}
```

### Stat Rolling Distributions

**Not all distributions are equal.** The shape of the roll determines how the item *feels*:

```js
// Uniform: equal chance of any value. Feels "anything goes."
function rollUniform(min, max) {
  return min + Math.random() * (max - min);
}

// Weighted toward center (bell curve). Most items are "average," extremes are rare.
// Good default for most stat rolling.
function rollBellCurve(min, max) {
  // Average of 3 uniform rolls approximates normal distribution
  const r = (Math.random() + Math.random() + Math.random()) / 3;
  return min + r * (max - min);
}

// Weighted toward high end. For rare/epic+ items — they should feel good.
function rollSkewedHigh(min, max, skew = 2) {
  const r = 1 - Math.pow(Math.random(), skew); // higher skew = more top-heavy
  return min + r * (max - min);
}

// Tiered: roll quality tier first, then value within tier.
// Best for systems where items have visible quality labels (e.g., "Superior Iron Sword").
function rollTiered(min, max, qualityWeights = [50, 30, 15, 5]) {
  // weights: [low, mid, high, perfect]
  const tierIdx = weightedPick(qualityWeights.map((w, i) => ({ value: i, weight: w })));
  const tierCount = qualityWeights.length;
  const tierMin = min + (max - min) * (tierIdx / tierCount);
  const tierMax = min + (max - min) * ((tierIdx + 1) / tierCount);
  return rollUniform(tierMin, tierMax);
}
```

**Rarity → distribution mapping (defaults):**
- Common / Uncommon: `rollBellCurve` (most are mediocre, few surprises)
- Rare: `rollBellCurve` with slight high bias
- Epic: `rollSkewedHigh(skew=1.5)` (should feel good)
- Legendary: `rollSkewedHigh(skew=2.5)` (should almost always feel great)

### Procedural Affix System (Advanced — ARPGs / Complex RPGs)

For games where items have random modifier combinations:

```js
const affixPool = [
  { id: 'sharp',    stat: 'attack',  range: [3, 8],   tags: ['weapon'],       weight: 100 },
  { id: 'sturdy',   stat: 'defense', range: [2, 6],   tags: ['armor'],        weight: 100 },
  { id: 'blazing',  stat: 'fireDmg', range: [5, 15],  tags: ['weapon'],       weight: 30 },
  { id: 'vampiric', stat: 'lifesteal', range: [1, 3], tags: ['weapon', 'ring'], weight: 10 },
  // ...
];

function generateAffixes(itemTags, rarity, itemLevel) {
  const affixCount = { common: 1, uncommon: 2, rare: 3, epic: 4, legendary: 5 }[rarity];
  const eligible = affixPool.filter(a =>
    a.tags.some(t => itemTags.includes(t)) &&
    (!a.minLevel || itemLevel >= a.minLevel)
  );

  const selected = [];
  const usedStats = new Set();
  for (let i = 0; i < affixCount && eligible.length > 0; i++) {
    // Filter out duplicate stat types
    const available = eligible.filter(a => !usedStats.has(a.stat));
    if (available.length === 0) break;
    const affix = weightedPick(available.map(a => ({ value: a, weight: a.weight })));
    selected.push({
      ...affix,
      value: rollSkewedHigh(affix.range[0], affix.range[1],
        rarity === 'legendary' ? 2.5 : rarity === 'epic' ? 1.5 : 1),
    });
    usedStats.add(affix.stat);
  }
  return selected;
}
```

### Part-Based Generation (Borderlands-Style)

For games where items are assembled from visual/mechanical parts:

```js
const weaponParts = {
  body:    [{ id: 'std', stats: {}, weight: 60 }, { id: 'heavy', stats: { attack: 2, speed: -1 }, weight: 30 }],
  barrel:  [{ id: 'short', stats: { range: -5 }, weight: 50 }, { id: 'long', stats: { range: 10, speed: -2 }, weight: 30 }],
  grip:    [{ id: 'wood', stats: {}, weight: 70 }, { id: 'bone', stats: { crit: 3 }, weight: 20 }],
  // Rarity gates: higher rarity unlocks more part slots
  enchant: [{ id: 'flame', stats: { fireDmg: 8 }, weight: 10, minRarity: 'rare' }],
};

function assembleWeapon(rarity) {
  const item = { parts: {}, stats: {} };
  for (const [slot, parts] of Object.entries(weaponParts)) {
    const eligible = parts.filter(p => !p.minRarity || rarityRank(rarity) >= rarityRank(p.minRarity));
    if (eligible.length === 0) continue;
    const part = weightedPick(eligible.map(p => ({ value: p, weight: p.weight })));
    item.parts[slot] = part.id;
    for (const [stat, val] of Object.entries(part.stats)) {
      item.stats[stat] = (item.stats[stat] || 0) + val;
    }
  }
  return item;
}
```

---

## SUBSYSTEM 3: PRESENTATION (How It Feels)

Presentation is the multiplier. The same item delivered flat vs. delivered with choreography produces dramatically different emotional responses.

### The Reveal Curve

Every loot moment follows this temporal structure — a compressed anticipation arc:

```
[SPAWN] → [INDICATION] → [SETTLE] → [COLLECT] → [REVEAL] → [INTEGRATE]
  0ms       50-200ms      200-600ms   on contact    0-800ms     after
```

1. **Spawn**: item appears in the world (burst from enemy, chest lid, etc.)
2. **Indication**: rarity signal before player reaches it (glow color, particle density, sound pitch)
3. **Settle**: item lands and rests — *anticipation lives here* (heavier items settle slower)
4. **Collect**: player touches / magnets item — tactile snap
5. **Reveal**: show what it is — scale with rarity (common: instant; legendary: dramatic sequence)
6. **Integrate**: UI updates, stat changes, inventory slot highlights

**Critical rule:** The time between "I can see it might be good" (Indication) and "I know what it is" (Reveal) is where excitement lives. Scale this gap with rarity.

### Reveal Timing Per Rarity

| Tier | Spawn → Settle | Indication Signal | Collect Feel | Reveal Duration | UI Integration |
|------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Common | 100–200ms, fast arc | none / white glow | instant snap | 0ms (immediate) | quiet counter tick |
| Uncommon | 200–300ms | faint green glow | quick magnet | 50ms pop | soft UI highlight |
| Rare | 300–450ms, higher arc | blue glow + sparkle | medium magnet, scale pop | 250ms sequence | UI pulse + text |
| Epic | 400–600ms, dramatic arc | purple glow + particles + ground light | slow approach, weighty collect | 500ms fanfare | UI flash + shake |
| Legendary | 600–900ms, peak hang time | gold glow + beacon + screen dim + hitstop on spawn | player walks to it (reduced/no magnet) | 800ms+ full choreography | full UI celebration |

### Pickup Physics

Items are objects the player interacts with through proximity. Their physics communicate value.

```js
// --- Rarity-scaled physics presets ---
const pickupPhysics = {
  common:    { velY: -180, velXSpread: 80,  gravity: 600, bounce: 0.3, friction: 0.9, settleDelay: 100,  magnetRadius: 80,  magnetAccel: 800 },
  uncommon:  { velY: -220, velXSpread: 100, gravity: 550, bounce: 0.4, friction: 0.88, settleDelay: 200,  magnetRadius: 60,  magnetAccel: 600 },
  rare:      { velY: -280, velXSpread: 120, gravity: 480, bounce: 0.45, friction: 0.85, settleDelay: 400,  magnetRadius: 45,  magnetAccel: 500 },
  epic:      { velY: -350, velXSpread: 60,  gravity: 400, bounce: 0.35, friction: 0.82, settleDelay: 700,  magnetRadius: 30,  magnetAccel: 350 },
  legendary: { velY: -400, velXSpread: 30,  gravity: 320, bounce: 0.25, friction: 0.78, settleDelay: 1200, magnetRadius: 0,   magnetAccel: 0 },
  // Legendary: no magnet — player must walk to it (builds anticipation)
};

// --- Pickup entity ---
function spawnPickup(x, y, rarity, itemData) {
  const p = pickupPhysics[rarity];
  return {
    x, y,
    vx: (Math.random() - 0.5) * p.velXSpread,
    vy: p.velY + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 40,
    gravity: p.gravity,
    bounce: p.bounce,
    friction: p.friction,
    grounded: false,
    settleTimer: 0,
    settled: false,
    settleDelay: p.settleDelay,
    magnetRadius: p.magnetRadius,
    magnetAccel: p.magnetAccel,
    rarity,
    itemData,
    collectible: false, // becomes true after settle
    age: 0,
  };
}

// --- Physics update (call per dt) ---
function updatePickup(pickup, dt, playerX, playerY) {
  const dtS = dt / 1000;
  pickup.age += dt;

  if (!pickup.grounded) {
    pickup.vy += pickup.gravity * dtS;
    pickup.x += pickup.vx * dtS;
    pickup.y += pickup.vy * dtS;

    // Ground collision (floorY = your ground level)
    if (pickup.y >= floorY) {
      pickup.y = floorY;
      pickup.vy *= -pickup.bounce;
      pickup.vx *= pickup.friction;
      if (Math.abs(pickup.vy) < 15) {
        pickup.vy = 0;
        pickup.grounded = true;
      }
    }
  } else if (!pickup.settled) {
    pickup.settleTimer += dt;
    if (pickup.settleTimer >= pickup.settleDelay) {
      pickup.settled = true;
      pickup.collectible = true;
    }
  }

  // Magnet behavior (only when collectible and has magnet)
  if (pickup.collectible && pickup.magnetRadius > 0) {
    const dx = playerX - pickup.x;
    const dy = playerY - pickup.y;
    const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

    if (dist < pickup.magnetRadius && dist > 1) {
      // Acceleration increases as distance decreases (inverse relationship)
      const strength = pickup.magnetAccel * (1 - dist / pickup.magnetRadius);
      const nx = dx / dist;
      const ny = dy / dist;
      pickup.x += nx * strength * dtS;
      pickup.y += ny * strength * dtS;

      // Snap when very close
      if (dist < 8) return 'collect';
    }
  }

  // Direct overlap collection (for items with no magnet)
  if (pickup.collectible) {
    const dx = playerX - pickup.x;
    const dy = playerY - pickup.y;
    if (Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy) < 16) return 'collect';
  }

  return 'alive';
}
```

**Key insight — inverted magnet by rarity:** Common items vacuum to the player (they're not worth walking to). Legendary items have no magnet — the player must approach, building anticipation during the walk.

### Reward Fanfare Choreography

The "feel-good" sequence when an item is collected. Each step is a tween/event with specific timing:

```js
// --- Fanfare system (event-driven, not setTimeout) ---
const fanfareSequences = {
  common: [
    // Simple snap — barely noticeable, never annoying
    { at: 0, do: 'scalePopUI', params: { scale: 1.15, durationMs: 80, ease: 'outBack' } },
    { at: 0, do: 'particles', params: { count: 3, type: 'sparkle', spread: 20 } },
  ],

  uncommon: [
    { at: 0, do: 'scalePopUI', params: { scale: 1.25, durationMs: 120, ease: 'outBack' } },
    { at: 0, do: 'particles', params: { count: 6, type: 'sparkle', spread: 30 } },
    { at: 0, do: 'floatText', params: { text: '+item', color: '#4ade80', riseMs: 600 } },
  ],

  rare: [
    { at: 0,   do: 'hitstop', params: { ms: 40 } },
    { at: 0,   do: 'cameraShake', params: { trauma: 0.06 } },
    { at: 0,   do: 'particles', params: { count: 12, type: 'burst', spread: 50 } },
    { at: 40,  do: 'itemRevealUI', params: { rarity: 'rare', durationMs: 250 } },
    { at: 40,  do: 'floatText', params: { text: '+item', color: '#60a5fa', riseMs: 800 } },
    { at: 200, do: 'scalePopUI', params: { scale: 1.3, durationMs: 150, ease: 'outBack' } },
  ],

  epic: [
    { at: 0,   do: 'hitstop', params: { ms: 80 } },

// --- Fanfare runner (integrates with game loop) ---
function runFanfare(rarity, context) {
  const seq = fanfareSequences[rarity];
  const events = seq.map(e => ({ ...e, fired: false, startTime: context.time + e.at }));
  // Add to active fanfares list — update() checks timing and fires each event
  activeFanfares.push({ events, startTime: context.time });
}

function updateFanfares(currentTime) {
  for (const fanfare of activeFanfares) {
    for (const event of fanfare.events) {
      if (!event.fired && currentTime >= event.startTime) {
        event.fired = true;
        executeFanfareEvent(event.do, event.params);
      }
    }
  }
  // Cleanup completed fanfares
  activeFanfares = activeFanfares.filter(f =>
    f.events.some(e => !e.fired)
  );
}
```

### Chest / Crate Breakables

Containers are a **two-phase reward moment**: break the container (satisfying), then receive the contents (exciting).

```js
function openChest(chest) {
  // Phase 1: Break animation (anticipation)
  // - Lid flies open with rotation + arc
  // - Dust/debris particles burst outward
  // - Hitstop: 60–120ms depending on chest tier
  // - Camera punch toward chest

  // Phase 2: Contents eruption (reward)
  // - Brief delay after break (80–150ms) — the "peek inside" moment
  // - Items burst upward in a spread pattern (fan or fountain)
  // - Higher rarity items launch higher and settle slower
  // - Stagger spawn: common first, rare last (builds anticipation within the burst)

  const drops = rollMultipleDrops(chest.table, chest.dropCount);
  // Sort: common first, legendary last
  drops.sort((a, b) => rarityRank(a.rarity) - rarityRank(b.rarity));

  drops.forEach((drop, i) => {
    const stagger = i * 60; // ms between each item spawn
    setTimeout(() => {
      const angle = -Math.PI / 2 + (i - drops.length / 2) * 0.3; // fan spread
      spawnPickupWithVelocity(chest.x, chest.y, drop, angle);
    }, 100 + stagger); // 100ms initial delay after chest break
  });
}
```

### Particle Recipes Per Event

Use pooled particles (see Game Juice skill). Specific recipes:

```js
const particleRecipes = {
  // Enemy death → loot spawn moment
  deathBurst: { count: 8, velRange: [80, 200], angle: [0, 2 * Math.PI], life: [200, 400], size: [2, 5], gravity: 100, colors: ['#fff', '#ff0'] },

  // Item lands on ground
  landDust: { count: 4, velRange: [20, 60], angle: [-Math.PI, 0], life: [150, 300], size: [3, 6], gravity: -20, colors: ['#ccc', '#999'] },

  // Item idle glow (continuous, low rate)
  idleSparkle: { count: 1, velRange: [5, 20], angle: [0, 2 * Math.PI], life: [300, 600], size: [1, 3], gravity: -30, colors: null }, // color from rarity

  // Collection pop
  collectBurst: { count: 6, velRange: [40, 120], angle: [0, 2 * Math.PI], life: [100, 250], size: [2, 4], gravity: 0, colors: null }, // color from rarity

  // Legendary beacon (vertical column)
  legendaryBeacon: { count: 2, velRange: [100, 200], angle: [-Math.PI / 2 - 0.1, -Math.PI / 2 + 0.1], life: [400, 800], size: [2, 4], gravity: -50, colors: ['#fbbf24', '#f59e0b'] },
};

// Per rarity glow colors
const rarityColors = {
  common: ['#d1d5db'],
  uncommon: ['#4ade80', '#22c55e'],
  rare: ['#60a5fa', '#3b82f6'],
  epic: ['#a855f7', '#7c3aed'],
  legendary: ['#fbbf24', '#f59e0b', '#fff'],
};
```

### UI Integration

The "Integrate" phase of the reveal curve. Loot isn't real until the UI acknowledges it:

```js
// Score / currency tick-up (never instant)
function animateCounter(element, from, to, durationMs = 400) {
  const start = performance.now();
  function tick(now) {
    const p = Math.min(1, (now - start) / durationMs);
    const eased = easeOutQuad(p);
    element.value = Math.round(from + (to - from) * eased);
    if (p < 1) requestAnimationFrame(tick);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(tick);
}

// Inventory slot highlight
// - New item slot pulses (scale 1 → 1.2 → 1, 300ms, outBack)
// - Rarity border glow fades in
// - If replacing an equipped item: show stat comparison with green/red arrows

// Toast / banner for rare+ drops
// - Slides in from edge, holds 1.5–3s (longer for higher rarity), slides out
// - Show item name, rarity color, key stat
// - Never stack more than 2 toasts — queue overflow
```

---

## Genre Presets

Use as starting points, then customize:

### Roguelike / Roguelite
- High drop frequency, moderate rarity spread
- Items define the "build" — variety > raw power
- Pity: per-run (not persistent across deaths), biased toward unseen items
- Presentation: fast, snappy — don't slow the run
- Smart loot: bias toward synergistic items ("no bad runs")

### Action RPG (Diablo-like)
- Moderate drop frequency, wide rarity spread, deep stat generation
- Items are the progression — power and build diversity
- Pity: persistent across sessions, per-slot or per-tier
- Presentation: scale with rarity — commons are fast, legendaries stop the world
- Smart loot: class-appropriate bias on epic+ drops

### Platformer / Action (Hollow Knight-like)
- Low item frequency, mostly currencies + consumables, rare permanent upgrades
- Currency pickup physics matter most — satisfying coin vacuum
- Pity: usually not needed (drops are frequent currencies)
- Presentation: snappy physics, satisfying magnet, minimal UI interruption

### Idle / Incremental
- Very high drop frequency, abstracted physics (items fly to UI, not ground)
- Numbers are the reward — big tick-ups, multiplier popups
- Pity: soft pity on prestige/ascension rewards
- Presentation: quantity spectacle — shower of items, rapid counter tick-up

---

## Simulation & Validation (Mandatory)

Before shipping, run your drop tables through simulation:

```js
function simulateDrops(table, rolls, pityState) {
  const results = { total: rolls, drops: {}, streaks: {}, pityTriggers: 0 };
  let currentStreak = 0;
  let maxStreak = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < rolls; i++) {
    const drop = rollWithPity(table, pityState);
    if (drop) {
      const key = drop.rarity;
      results.drops[key] = (results.drops[key] || 0) + 1;
      if (currentStreak > maxStreak) maxStreak = currentStreak;
      currentStreak = 0;
    } else {
      currentStreak++;
    }
  }

  results.maxDryStreak = Math.max(maxStreak, currentStreak);
  console.log('=== Simulation Results ===');
  console.log(`Rolls: ${rolls}`);
  for (const [rarity, count] of Object.entries(results.drops)) {
    console.log(`${rarity}: ${count} (${(count / rolls * 100).toFixed(2)}%)`);
  }
  console.log(`Worst dry streak: ${results.maxDryStreak}`);
  console.log(`Pity triggers: ${results.pityTriggers}`);
  return results;
}

// Run it:
// simulateDrops(skeletonTable, 10000, { count: 0, hardCeiling: 80 });
```

**What to check:**
- Does each rarity's actual rate match the intended rate (within ±1% at 10k rolls)?
- Is the worst dry streak acceptable? (Rule of thumb: max streak should be < 3× the expected interval)
- How often does pity trigger? (If > 5% of rare+ drops are pity-forced, your base rate might be too low)
- Does the upgrade cadence match Pass 0 targets? (Convert drop rate × average play speed → minutes between upgrades)

## Edge Cases & Robustness

### Empty pool after filtering
```js
// If smart loot / level filtering leaves zero eligible items in a tier:
// → Fall back to next-lower rarity tier, OR
// → Drop a generic currency reward, OR
// → Drop nothing (never crash, never drop undefined)
function safeRollFromPool(pool) {
  if (pool.length === 0) return { itemId: 'gold_coins', rarity: 'common', isFallback: true };
  return pool[Math.floor(Math.random() * pool.length)];
}
```

### Inventory overflow
When the player's inventory is full: don't silently destroy drops. Options: leave item on ground with a timer, auto-convert to currency, or pop a "full inventory" warning before opening chests.

### Pity counter persistence
Pity state must serialize into save data. Structure:
```js
const saveData = {
  pity: {
    global: { count: 14, hardCeiling: 80 },      // general drop pity
    perEnemy: { 'boss_dragon': { count: 3, hardCeiling: 5 } },  // boss-specific
  },
  dropHistory: ['iron_sword', 'cloth', 'bone'],   // recent N drops for anti-repeat
  lastLegendaryTime: 1708300000,                   // for session-level pacing
};
```

### Multiplayer loot modes
- **Individual**: each player rolls independently (simple, no conflicts)
- **Shared (FFA)**: one drop, race to pick up (creates tension but also griefing)
- **Shared (round-robin)**: drops alternate between players
- **Instanced**: one drop event, each player sees/gets their own roll (Diablo 3 model — recommended default)

### Extreme grind protection
If a player grinds 10× expected playtime, the economy can collapse (too many items). Options: diminishing returns on drop rates per session, item durability/degradation, increasingly expensive upgrade costs, or soft caps on total items.

## Guardrails & Accessibility

### Toggles (mandatory):
- `reduceFanfare` — skip screen dim, slowmo, beacon effects; keep item pop and UI update
- `reduceFlashes` — disable screen flash; use glow outlines instead
- `reduceParticles` — halve counts, shorten lifetimes
- `skipRevealAnimation` — instant reveal for all rarities (speedrunner mode)
- `showDropRates` — display actual probabilities in UI (transparency option)

### Safety defaults:
- Screen flashes: never full-opacity, never full-screen white, max 100ms duration
- Slowmo on legendary: cap at 600ms, always resume to full speed smoothly
- Fanfare: never block player input for more than 200ms (hitstop limit)
- Particle density: auto-scale down if FPS drops below 45

---

## Engineering Reality (JavaScript)

### Performance rules:
- **Pool all pickups and particles.** Pre-allocate arrays. Never `new` in the drop path.
- **dt-based everything.** Pickup physics, tweens, magnet curves, fanfare timers — all use dt from the game loop.
- **Timescale-aware.** If hitstop/slowmo affects the game clock, pickup physics should freeze too (they're in sim time). Fanfare tweens should advance on presentation time (so the reveal doesn't freeze mid-animation).
- **Batch renders.** If 20 coins drop at once, draw them in one pass (instancing or sprite batching), not 20 individual draw calls.

### Data architecture:
- Item definitions: static data, loaded once. Keep in a flat lookup object keyed by ID.
- Drop tables: static data, per-enemy or per-zone. Reference item IDs, not item objects.
- Generated items: runtime instances with rolled stats. Store in inventory as serializable objects.
- Pity state: persisted. Part of save data. Reset on appropriate boundaries (per-run for roguelikes, persistent for ARPGs).
- Pickup entities: pooled, ephemeral. Part of the entity system, not the item system.

## The Loot Checklist (Ship Gate)

### Selection
- [ ] Drop tables are hierarchical (tier → item), not flat
- [ ] Rare drops use PRD or pity protection — never naked RNG
- [ ] Pity counters persist across sessions (if appropriate for genre)
- [ ] Smart loot filtering has a fallback for empty pools
- [ ] Simulation confirms rates match design intent at 10k+ rolls
- [ ] Worst-case dry streaks are within acceptable bounds

### Generation
- [ ] Stat rolling uses appropriate distribution per rarity (bell curve → skewed high)
- [ ] Higher rarity consistently produces higher quality (no "bad legendary" surprise)
- [ ] Items feel distinct — not just +1 to the same stat
- [ ] Affix/part systems prevent nonsensical combinations

### Presentation
- [ ] Every rarity tier has a distinct visual/physical/temporal signature
- [ ] Pickup physics scale with rarity (light→heavy, fast magnet→walk to it)
- [ ] Reveal timing scales with rarity (instant→dramatic)
- [ ] Fanfare never blocks input for more than 200ms
- [ ] UI integration is animated, not instant (counter tick-up, slot highlight)
- [ ] Chest/crate opening has two-phase feel (break + contents burst)

### Economy
- [ ] Inflow and outflow are identified
- [ ] Upgrade cadence matches design target (exciting drop every ~N minutes)
- [ ] Drop rate doesn't collapse under extended play sessions

### Accessibility & Engineering
- [ ] Fanfare reduction toggle exists
- [ ] Drop rate transparency option exists
- [ ] All physics/tweens are dt-based
- [ ] Pickups and particles are pooled (no GC spikes)
- [ ] Timescale-aware (hitstop doesn't break pickup physics)
- [ ] Works in multiplayer (loot mode specified)
