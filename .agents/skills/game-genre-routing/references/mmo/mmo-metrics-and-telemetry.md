# MMO Metrics and Telemetry

Use this when defining success, failure, dashboards, launch gates, or instrumentation. Metrics are proxies; every metric needs a counter-metric that catches the way it can lie.

## Core Measurement Principle

Measure the full chain:

```text
contact → usefulness → recognition → chosen obligation → repair → memory
```

Add the RSC primitive loop when relevant:

```text
place → profession/market/risk loop → repeated usefulness → reputation → memory
```

Throughput alone is not MMO health. Completion, concurrency, retention, and revenue can rise while recognition, repair, returnability, profession identity, and institutions decay.

## Metric Map

| Concept | Primary signals | Counter-signals / traps |
|---|---|---|
| Contact | Co-presence, local dwell, inspections, chat exposure, public-event proximity, repeated area overlap. | Dense crowds with low interaction; AFK clustering; global chat noise. |
| Usefulness | Revives, buffs, heals, trades, crafts, warnings, escorts, callouts, role fills, teaching, leader pings followed. | Parallel solo completion; assists only from reward farming; unthanked utility. |
| Recognition | Commends, follows, friend adds, preferred stranger marks, repeat grouping, leader follow, guild inquiry, seller repeat business. | High completion with low repeat contact; anonymous market transactions; no remembered names. |
| Chosen obligation | Role declarations, event signups, loot-policy consent, squad attendance, leader acceptance, prog/farm/story/speed tags, work orders. | Role-based kicks; “I never agreed” complaints; expectation discovered after failure. |
| Repair | Wipe-to-retry rate, requeue-after-failure, successful regroup, loot dispute resolution, leader reattempt rate, loss return. | Rage quits, silent disbands, support-role churn, post-failure avoidance. |
| Memory | Named-location callouts, recurring venue attendance, old route references, leader/guild/profession reputation, return to region, event anniversaries, title/item usage. | Content cleared but never discussed; places not named; leaders not followed; no rituals. |
| Profession identity | Public production, work orders, repeat customers, visible service history, route mastery. | Private XP spreadsheets, no seller/crafter recognition, pure auction abstraction. |
| Market ritual | Live offers, commissions, negotiated trades, seller history, local market dwell. | Spam, price-row anonymity, forced idling, global market flattening. |
| Risk gradient | Frontier staging, stake previews, scouts, named fight locations, return after loss. | Surprise loss, unclear boundary, one-sided farming, players never return. |

## Feature-Specific Metrics

### Dungeon / Finder / Group Execution

Completion + repeat-party rate; queue time + role mismatch; wipe count + retry rate; rewards/hour + commend/play-again; support-role participation + blame/leaver rate.

Interpretation rule: a finder is socially healthy when it moves players from strangers to preferred strangers at least some of the time.

### Guilds / Squads / Institutions

Guild membership + members grouped with each other; large roster + officer workload; recruitment volume + retention; event count + cancellation; role shortage + substitution success.

Interpretation rule: guild chat is not proof of playable institution health.

### Leaders

Leader follow rate + follower retention after failure; event wins + learner participation; command uptime + leader burnout.

Interpretation rule: leaders manufacture sessions; reward session quality, not only victory.

### Cities / Hubs / Bank-Stages

Dwell after service completion + AFK clutter; inspection rate + gatekeeping; local/trade chat density + noise; commission usage + seller recognition; district usage + spam dominance.

Interpretation rule: a hub is social when players notice, judge, perform for, need, trade with, or remember one another.

### Skilling / Professions / RSC-Style Locality

| Healthy signal | Counter-metric |
|---|---|
| Public production | Private spreadsheet skilling, no repeat customers, no visible experts. |
| Profession-route recurrence | Dead travel, bot-like repetition, route fatigue. |
| Commission usage | Pure auction abstraction, no seller identity, no negotiation memory. |
| Bank/hub social activity | Spam dominance, AFK clutter, forced idle, trade noise. |
| High-level return to low-tier routes | New-player displacement, resource griefing, prestige farming only. |

Interpretation rule: an RSC-style skill loop is healthy only when it creates visible useful identity, not when it merely slows progress.

### Public Events / World Bosses / Massive Objectives

Participation + local contribution diversity; completion + reward satisfaction; population density + readability/performance; return participation + named-location memory.

Interpretation rule: massive participation is useful only if players understand their local job and remember who helped.

### Economy / Crafting / Market

Transaction volume + seller recognition; low prices + crafter retention; crafting participation + repeat customers; liquidity + local commerce; market anomaly + prestige trust.

Interpretation rule: economies attack trust before prices; visible legitimacy matters.

### Risk Frontiers

Crossings + return after loss; kill/death volume + fight quality; scout usage + route callouts; trophy usage + named-location memory; reward value + loss resentment.

Interpretation rule: a frontier is healthy when players knowingly return after loss with a story or lesson.

### Progression / Returnability

Daily engagement + captivity sentiment; gear progression + friend compatibility; catch-up completion + time to play with friends; prestige participation + social exclusion.

Interpretation rule: a player who leaves for a patch should not return as an exile.

## Metric Traps

| Metric looks good | But may mean |
|---|---|
| High concurrency | Crowded anonymity, spectacle without memory. |
| High completion | Content is transactional, over-carried, or socially sterile. |
| Fast queues | Role quality, learning, and repeat recognition were sacrificed. |
| High retention | Captivity loop, chores, fear of falling behind. |
| High guild membership | Empty shells, recruitment spam, no squad integration. |
| High market volume | Zero merchant identity, price-row anonymity, prestige erosion. |
| High skilling participation | Private grind with no profession memory. |
| High frontier kills | One-sided farming, unclear risk, players not returning. |
| High log/API usage | Base UI failure or elite gatekeeping. |

## Dashboard Rule

Every dashboard tile should pair one efficiency metric with one social-health counter-metric.

```text
Dungeon completion rate + repeat-party rate
Queue time + role-mismatch complaints
World-event participation + local-objective contribution diversity
Guild membership + first-week member grouping
Leader wins + follower return after failure
Market volume + repeat seller/customer relationships
Skilling XP/hour + visible profession-service use
Risk-frontier crossings + return after loss
Daily engagement + missed-patch return success
```

## Classic EverQuest Dependency Metrics

Use these when the design depends on player services, camps, public dungeons, recoverable danger, travel, or market identity.

| Concept | Signals | Counter-signals |
|---|---|---|
| Player-service identity | Service request fulfillment, repeat patrons, service-provider retention, service reputation, service-to-friend conversion. | Players bypass services with anonymous buttons; service scarcity blocks play; service providers burn out. |
| Recoverable danger | Rescue rate, retry rate, group re-form, route-risk learning, return after loss, rescue commendations. | Rage quit after death, long unrecovered loss, friend-level exile, risk avoidance, blame spikes. |
| Camp etiquette | Camp turnover quality, replacement queue success, train warning usage, local callouts, repeat encounters at named camps. | Camp disputes, kill stealing reports, train grief, sterile private instances, no named-place memory. |
| Public dungeon ecology | Puller/controller recognition, local chat, group formation in-zone, recovery from bad pulls, named-route callouts. | Anonymous zergs, unreadable chaos, no repeated strangers, support burden. |
| Travel memory | Route diversity, guide/porter usage, staging dwell, last-mile stories, escort success, local hub recurrence. | Instant-menu flattening, dead travel abandonment, port/service role collapse. |
| Merchant identity | Repeat customers, seller follow, commission fulfillment, live-market lane use, barter conversion, seller reputation. | Pure price-row shopping, no merchant recall, undercut-only competition, global market anonymity. |
| Luclin substitution risk | Convenience adoption plus preservation of seller/service/route recognition. | Time saved rises while merchant identity, player services, regional dwell, and repeat contact fall. |

Metric rule:

```text
If convenience improves throughput, verify that recognition did not fall.
```

## World of Warcraft Social-Residue Metrics

Use these when reviewing access tools, queue systems, layered populations, timed progression, tokenized economies, world rewrites, or Classic-vs-retail nostalgia claims.

| Concept | Signals | Counter-signals |
|---|---|---|
| Access without social aftercare | Queue success plus repeat-party prompts, recent-ally conversion, role-intent clarity, learning-mode success. | Completion rises while repeat grouping, thanks, guild inquiry, and preferred-stranger formation fall. |
| Dungeon finder social residue | Same-party requeue, commend/follow after run, leader/friendly-player recall, apology/retry after wipe. | Fast queues plus silence, kicks, no repeat contact, and role-blame churn. |
| Raid finder spectacle access | First-clear accessibility, learning progression, story completion, low-pressure role practice. | Raid identity flattens, prestige confusion rises, or access mode teaches bad habits for harder modes. |
| Cross-realm / no-server population smoothing | Alive spaces, stable local cohorts, recurring names by geography/profession/activity. | Population is technically full but socially placeless; players never re-encounter recognizable strangers. |
| Mythic+ pressure | Group completion by key type, route literacy, post-failure requeue, role retention, non-timer completion modes. | Abandon-on-first-mistake, meta comp collapse, tank/healer anxiety, route blame, timer-induced toxicity. |
| Add-on/log dependency | Base UI success for ordinary roles, new-player competence without external tools, learning from official recap. | Mandatory add-ons, external route sheets, log gatekeeping, hidden-mechanic superstition. |
| Token/boost/prestige leakage | Clear separation between paid convenience, gold wealth, carried achievement, earned mastery, and social trust. | Players cannot tell whether status came from skill, time, money, carry, or guild support. |
| World rewrite memory | Preserved landmarks, old-to-new callouts, veteran memory bridges, newcomer clarity. | Efficient new world but erased place folklore; veterans experience improvement as loss. |
| Seasonal treadmill | Re-engagement after skipped season, friend catch-up time, old-system retirement clarity. | Missed season becomes exile; players return to chores instead of friends. |

Metric rule:

```text
For every WoW-style optimization, pair throughput with social-residue counters.
```

Examples:

```text
Queue time + repeat-party rate
Raid access + prestige clarity
Population density + recurring-name rate
Timed completion + post-failure retry
Token volume + prestige-legibility sentiment
Patch reactivation + time-to-play-with-friends
World rewrite adoption + preserved-place memory
```

## FFXIV Metrics Addendum

Use these when testing returnability, story onboarding, low-pressure grouping, and social expression.

| Claim | Primary metric | Counter-metric |
|---|---|---|
| Story onboarding works | MSQ continuation, first-dungeon completion, recap use, first-week return. | Time until player can meaningfully play with friends; story-skip pressure; drop-off at known quest walls. |
| Duty Support helps | NPC-duty completion, reduced story dungeon abandonment. | Human group conversion after NPC clears; roulette participation; first human duty anxiety/churn. |
| Roulettes create healthy contact | Old-content fill rate, veteran participation, first-time clear support. | Repeat grouping, commendation rate, post-duty play-again, veteran resentment, speedrun pressure on sprouts. |
| Community is welcoming | New-player retention, first-time completion, commendations. | Recognition depth: friend adds, linkshell/FC joins, repeat allies, learning-group continuation. |
| Party Finder works | Fill time by purpose tag, clear rate by tag, tag accuracy. | Disband after first failure, mismatched expectation reports, blacklist/refusal patterns. |
| Returnability works | Time from login after absence to current meaningful play. | Chore wall, reactivation failure, friends played-with within first session, catch-up abandonment. |
| Identity outside combat works | Glamour/plate/housing/event participation, profile views, visitor counts. | Identity concentration in combat logs/gear only; venue/event discovery outside client. |
| Patch cadence works | Patch return rate, completion of new content. | Formula fatigue: early drop-off, skipped systems, “checklist” sentiment, low social novelty. |
| Exodus readiness works | Trial-to-resident conversion, new-wave capacity stability, newcomer social conversion. | First-week confusion, comparison complaints, queue/congestion trust loss, tourist churn. |

### Metric traps

- High Duty Finder completion can hide disposable strangers.
- High free-trial registration can hide conversion failure.
- High MSQ completion can hide friend-exile debt.
- High venue attendance can hide off-client discovery dependence.
- High patch return can hide formula fatigue.
- High politeness can hide social thinness.

## Social Topology Metrics

Track both bonding and bridging.

| Concept | Example metrics |
|---|---|
| Weak ties | repeated low-commitment encounters, preferred-stranger recurrence, market repeat-customer rate |
| Strong ties | squad/static repeat rate, closure density, event attendance stability |
| Brokerage | cross-group event participation, mentor-to-guild conversion, market/diplomacy bridge roles |
| Third-place health | dwell after utility completion, regular reappearance, mixed-motive activity in one place |

## Institution Lifecycle Metrics

| Stage | Example metrics |
|---|---|
| Founding | first-30-day survival, first event hosted, member-to-player conversion |
| Growth | newcomer time-to-first-play, subgroup formation, role coverage |
| Maturity | leader concentration, event reliability, cross-subgroup overlap |
| Strain | officer churn, cancellation rate, subgroup exit cascades |
| Dormancy / return | dormancy duration, reactivation success, alumni reconnection |
| Merger | merged-group retention, charter acceptance, cross-roster play density |

## Sovereignty / Logistics Metrics

| Claim | Counter-metrics |
|---|---|
| Territorial system works | hold duration + supply burden; conquest frequency + maintenance labor; war scale + route participation; front clarity + coalition participation |
| Politics are alive | treaty creation, neutrality, betrayal events, coalition reformation, not just kill counts |
| Geography matters | chokepoint recurrence, staging-point usage, convoy route volume, rerouting under threat |

## History / Ritual Metrics

| Concept | Example metrics |
|---|---|
| Authored history | archive creation, monument interaction, historical recap views, named-place recall |
| Ritual health | attendance repeat rate, emotional recall, institution joins post-ritual, returner activation after commemorations |
| Memory survival | fraction of major events with visible traces 7/30/90 days later |

## AI-Native Metrics

| Concept | Example metrics |
|---|---|
| World coherence | contradiction rate, impossible promises, invalid quest issuance, canonical drift incidents |
| Quest provenance | issuer mix, reward-source validity, adjudication success, cancellation/invalidation rate |
| Social value of AI | % of AI-issued or AI-routed content that leads to human-human interaction, repeat grouping, or institutional conversion |
| Personalization risk | fraction of content visible only to one player, public-canon divergence complaints, comparability breaks |
| Agent control | override/steering rate, failed execution rate, memory retrieval quality, stale-memory incidents |
| Content remembrance | which generated quests/events players can still recall after 1/7/30 days |

## Metric traps to flag

- high concurrent attendance with low repeat-social conversion;
- strong guild retention with low cross-group permeability;
- political war counts with no logistics participation;
- many generated quests with low remembered consequence;
- high personalization satisfaction with collapsing shared reference points.

## Retention Architecture Telemetry

Do not instrument retention only as DAU, session length, streaks, and conversion. Pair every engagement metric with a health and meaning counter-metric.

| Concept | Signals | Counter-signal |
|---|---|---|
| Autonomy | self-authored goals, opt-in obligations, path diversity | forced chore completion, low perceived agency |
| Competence | mastery progression, retry improvement, guide-free success | wheel-spinning, opaque failure, external dependency |
| Relatedness | repeat useful contacts, thanks, invites, cohorts | anonymous completions, isolation after activity |
| Common identity | faction/district/profession participation, ritual attendance | identity slogans without contribution |
| Common bond | stable squads, return invites, pair recurrence | single-friend dependency |
| Social graph retention | bridge count, missing-player pings, cohort survival | broker burnout, clique isolation |
| Apprenticeship | peripheral-role uptake, apprentice-to-regular conversion | new-player spectatorship |
| Challenge fit | productive retry curves, mentor uptake | repeated failure with no improvement |
| Ownership | home/tool/map/profession updates, return-to-owned-space | hostage retention, loss anxiety |
| Team cognition | plan agreement, role/caller clarity, post-wipe repair | blame chat, repeated same-mechanic confusion |
| Commons governance | local rule compliance, dispute resolution time | monopoly, grief, operator-ticket load |
| Reputation | contract completion, dispute rate, contextual vouches | popularity-gaming, laundering |
| Algorithmic culture | serendipity acceptance, relationship value, creator exposure diversity | filter-bubble depth, venue/creator concentration |
| Experience memory | post-session recap saves, shares, gratitude, return hook acceptance | reward collection with no recall |
| Healthy passion | return-after-break, guilt-free skipping, positive sentiment | shame, fear of loss, compulsion language |

Interpretation trap:
A metric that rises while social trust, agency, or clean return falls is not MMO health. It is extraction or optimization debt.
