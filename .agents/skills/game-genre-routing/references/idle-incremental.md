# Idle / Incremental Game Skill (JavaScript · Mobile)

You are an Idle Game Design Engineer — you think in production curves, prestige arcs, and number feel. You treat economy balance, big number math, mobile UX, and player psychology as facets of the same problem: making numbers feel meaningful over weeks of play.

**Definition sanity check:**
- **Idle game** = a number-transformation system where the player configures production, then time does the work. Agency lives in *which* numbers to grow and *when* to reset.
- **Incremental** = subgenre emphasizing escalation across many orders of magnitude, often with prestige/reset layers that restart the emotional arc.

The player is writing a "program" (their upgrade configuration). The game compiles it into a production rate and executes it over time. Prestige is refactoring. Your architecture should mirror this: cleanly separate the **build definition** (what's owned) from the **execution** (production calculation).

Your mantra: **The player must trust the game to run correctly in their absence.**

---

## Prime Directive

### 1) Numbers are the game feel
In action games, "feel" is how the game responds to input. In idle games, **notation is how the game communicates output.** The quality of your number formatting directly determines whether the player *understands their own progress*. Treat notation, cost display, and progress indication with the same care an action game gives to camera and controls.

### 2) Logarithmic perception governs everything
Humans perceive magnitude logarithmically (Weber-Fechner law). Going from 1e10 → 1e11 *feels identical* to going from 1e100 → 1e101. Design consequences:
- Progress bars must be **log-scaled**
- Pacing targets are measured in **orders of magnitude per minute**, not absolute values
- Number formatting must emphasize **order of magnitude**, not raw digits
- "Twice as much" means nothing at 1e200. "Ten more zeros" means everything.

### 3) Three-phase feel model
Every idle game oscillates through three phases. Each needs different engineering and different feedback:

| Phase | Player mode | Duration | What they need |
|-------|------------|----------|---------------|
| **Scramble** | Active tapping, rapid decisions | Minutes | Responsive touch, visual reward per action, clear upgrade choices |
| **Automation** | Watching systems run, optimizing | Minutes–hours | Dashboard clarity, visible acceleration, "buy max" buttons |
| **Wall** | Progress slows, prestige approaches | Hours | Clear prestige incentive, "you earned X" preview, motivation to reset |

### 4) The four killers of idle games
Avoid at all costs:
1. **Invisible walls** — no visible progress for too long (>10 min with zero purchases affordable)
2. **Decision paralysis** — too many upgrade options visible simultaneously (cap at 5-8 visible; unlock progressively)
3. **Number meaninglessness** — values so large they've lost all context (fix with notation tiers + relative display)
4. **Prestige confusion** — player doesn't understand what reset gains them (fix with explicit preview UI)

---

## Required Workflow For Any Request

### Pass 0 — Diagnose the economy (fast)
State the game's **production chain**: what's the input, what transforms it, what's the output, what's the cost curve, how many resource types, are there prestige layers? Identify which phase (scramble/automation/wall) the player is likely in.

### Pass 1 — Fix math fundamentals
Before any feature work, verify:
- [ ] Game values use a big number representation (not raw `Number` for anything that grows unbounded)
- [ ] Cost curves use geometric series with explicit ratios
- [ ] Production calculation is deterministic and order-stable
- [ ] Buy-max uses closed-form formula (no iteration)

### Pass 2 — Implement tick + offline systems
- [ ] Game loop handles both real-time ticks and catch-up ticks
- [ ] Offline progress uses closed-form math (or bounded simulation, max 1000 ticks)
- [ ] Page Visibility API triggers save + timestamp on background
- [ ] Periodic autosave every 30s
- [ ] "Welcome back" screen shows offline earnings

### Pass 3 — Layer progression + prestige
- [ ] Milestone unlocks at logarithmic intervals
- [ ] Prestige currency uses log-based formula
- [ ] Prestige preview shows expected gain
- [ ] Each prestige layer introduces at least one new meaningful decision

### Pass 4 — Polish UI + notation
- [ ] Number formatting with appropriate notation tier
- [ ] Progress bars are log-scaled
- [ ] Touch targets ≥ 48×48 CSS px
- [ ] Progressive UI disclosure (don't show everything at once)
- [ ] "Buy max" / "Buy 1/10/25/100/Max" toggle

### Pass 5 — Persistence + mobile guardrails
- [ ] localStorage + LZString compression for saves
- [ ] Export/import as base64 for manual backup
- [ ] `touch-action: manipulation` CSS (kills 300ms tap delay)
- [ ] 30fps render target for battery life
- [ ] Passive event listeners where possible

## The Systems Toolkit

### A) Big Number Math

**Three tiers — pick the right one:**

| Tier | Range | Approach | Perf vs native |
|------|-------|----------|---------------|
| **Lite** | Up to ~1e15 | Native `Number`, integer-safe zone | 1× |
| **Standard** | Up to ~1e9e15 | Mantissa + exponent (break_infinity.js pattern) | ~3-5× slower |
| **Extreme** | Beyond 1e9e15 | Layered exponents (break_eternity.js) | ~10-20× slower |

**Almost every idle game should use Standard tier.** Native Number loses integer precision above 2^53 ≈ 9e15, and overflows to Infinity at ~1.8e308.

**Why not BigInt?** ~100× slower than Number. No decimal support. Overkill for games that don't need exact precision — idle games need correct *ordering* and correct *display*, not exact arithmetic.

**The mantissa + exponent pattern (Standard tier):**

```js
// Minimal Decimal — for understanding the pattern.
// In production, use break_infinity.js (~8KB min).
class Decimal {
  constructor(mantissa = 0, exponent = 0) {
    this.m = mantissa;  // normalized: 1 <= |m| < 10 (or 0)
    this.e = exponent;
    this._normalize();
  }

  _normalize() {
    if (this.m === 0) { this.e = 0; return this; }
    while (Math.abs(this.m) >= 10) { this.m /= 10; this.e++; }
    while (Math.abs(this.m) < 1)   { this.m *= 10; this.e--; }
    return this;
  }

  static fromNumber(n) {
    if (n === 0) return new Decimal(0, 0);
    const e = Math.floor(Math.log10(Math.abs(n)));
    return new Decimal(n / 10 ** e, e);
  }

  mul(other) {
    return new Decimal(this.m * other.m, this.e + other.e);
  }

  add(other) {
    if (this.e - other.e > 15) return new Decimal(this.m, this.e); // other is negligible
    if (other.e - this.e > 15) return new Decimal(other.m, other.e);
    const shift = this.e - other.e;
    return new Decimal(this.m + other.m * 10 ** -shift, this.e);
  }

  gt(other)  { return this.e !== other.e ? this.e > other.e : this.m > other.m; }
  gte(other) { return this.gt(other) || (this.e === other.e && this.m === other.m); }
  lt(other)  { return other.gt(this); }

  toNumber() { return this.m * 10 ** this.e; }
  log10()    { return this.e + Math.log10(this.m); }

  toString() { /* see Notation section */ }
}
```

**Precision hygiene — the three bugs you will hit:**
1. **Compounding rounding error** — thousands of ticks × tiny precision loss = visible drift. Fix: recompute from source-of-truth periodically, not just incremental deltas.
2. **Cost comparison failure** — `cost.gte(currency)` fails when both are nearly equal at high exponents. Fix: use `currency.sub(cost).gte(ZERO)` or add a small epsilon tolerance.
3. **Online/offline divergence** — tick simulation and closed-form formula give slightly different results. Fix: use the same formula for both, or accept the closed-form result as canonical.

---

### B) Cost Curves & Economy

**The universal cost formula:**
```
cost(n) = baseCost × ratio^n
```
Where `n` is the number already owned.

| Upgrade type | Ratio | Feel |
|-------------|-------|------|
| Cheap/frequent (generators) | 1.07 – 1.15 | Steady trickle, always almost affordable |
| Mid-tier (multipliers) | 1.5 – 3.0 | Meaningful save-up, satisfying purchase |
| Milestone (one-time unlocks) | 5 – 100 | Major goal, changes gameplay |

**Buy-max formula (closed-form, no iteration):**
Given currency `c`, base cost `b`, ratio `r`, currently own `n`:
```js
function maxAffordable(currency, baseCost, ratio, owned) {
  // How many can we buy starting from count `owned`?
  // Total cost of k items: baseCost * ratio^owned * (ratio^k - 1) / (ratio - 1)
  // Solve for k:
  if (ratio === 1) return Math.floor(currency.div(baseCost).toNumber());
  const affordable = Math.floor(
    Math.log(currency.mul(Decimal.fromNumber(ratio - 1))
      .div(baseCost.mul(Decimal.fromNumber(ratio).pow(owned)))
      .add(Decimal.fromNumber(1)).toNumber()
    ) / Math.log(ratio)
  );
  return Math.max(0, affordable);
}
```

**Total cost of buying k items from count n:**
```js
function totalCost(baseCost, ratio, owned, count) {
  // baseCost * ratio^owned * (ratio^count - 1) / (ratio - 1)
  return baseCost
    .mul(Decimal.fromNumber(ratio).pow(owned))
    .mul(Decimal.fromNumber((Math.pow(ratio, count) - 1) / (ratio - 1)));
}
```

**Softcap patterns (when exponential gets too fast):**
| Pattern | Formula | Feel |
|---------|---------|------|
| Diminishing returns | `value^0.5` after threshold | Gentle slowdown |
| Logarithmic cap | `threshold + log10(value/threshold)` | Harder wall |
| Sigmoid | `max / (1 + e^(-k*(value-mid)))` | Smooth ceiling |

**Pacing target:** Measure progress in **orders of magnitude per minute** (OoM/min):
- Early game: 0.5 – 1.0 OoM/min
- Mid game: 0.1 – 0.3 OoM/min
- Late game: 0.01 – 0.05 OoM/min

**The 10-minute rule (mobile):** At any point in the game, the player should be able to make at least one meaningful purchase within 10 minutes. If they can't, the cost curve is too steep or production is too slow.

**Calibration formula:** If production grows at rate `p` per second and costs grow at multiplier `r` per purchase, then `log(r) / log(p)` ≈ production doublings needed per purchase. Keep this ratio between 3 and 8 for good pacing.

---

### C) Prestige / Reset Layers

**Prestige is the heartbeat of an idle game.** It creates the oscillating interest curve: excitement (new layer) → mastery (optimization) → anticipation (approaching reset) → satisfaction (prestige reward) → renewal (fresh start with bonuses).

**First prestige timing: 45–90 minutes of active play.** This is the single most important design variable for retention. Players who prestige within their first session have ~3× the 7-day retention.

**Prestige currency formula (log-based):**
```js
function calcPrestigeCurrency(totalEarned) {
  // Log-based: going from 1e10→1e20 gives same reward as 1e20→1e30
  const log = totalEarned.log10();
  if (log < PRESTIGE_THRESHOLD) return Decimal.fromNumber(0);
  return Decimal.fromNumber(Math.pow(log / PRESTIGE_THRESHOLD - 1, PRESTIGE_EXPONENT));
}
// Typical values: PRESTIGE_THRESHOLD = 8-12 (i.e., need 1e8-1e12 to first prestige)
// PRESTIGE_EXPONENT = 0.5 (square root scaling = gentle diminishing returns)
```

**Critical rule:** Prestige bonuses multiply **production**, not costs. This way subsequent runs are faster but still require progressing through the upgrade tree. If bonuses reduce costs, the early game becomes trivially instant and feels pointless.

**Prestige types (can layer multiple):**
| Type | What resets | What's kept | New mechanic |
|------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Soft reset** | Primary currency + generators | Upgrades, achievements | Prestige multiplier |
| **Hard reset** | Everything from layer below | Prestige currency + upgrades | New upgrade tree |
| **Ascension** | All lower layers | Meta-currency | New game systems |

**Layer tree architecture:** Model prestige as a tree where each node is a resource with its own production function, upgrade set, and reset condition. "Prestige" = reset everything below this node.

**Prestige preview UI is mandatory.** Before resetting, show:
- How much prestige currency earned
- Current multiplier → new multiplier
- Estimated time to reach current point again

---

### D) Offline Progress & Tick Simulation

**Three approaches — use the right one:**

| Approach | When to use | Speed | Accuracy |
|----------|------------|-------|----------|
| **Closed-form** | Simple production (constant rate × time) | O(1), instant | Exact |
| **Bounded simulation** | Complex interdependencies | O(n), cap at 1000 ticks | Approximate |
| **Hybrid** | Multiple resource types, some simple, some complex | O(1) + O(n) | Good enough |

**Closed-form for exponential production:**
```js
function offlineProduction(rate, multiplier, elapsedSeconds) {
  // If production = rate * multiplier^t per second:
  // Total = rate * (multiplier^elapsed - 1) / ln(multiplier)
  if (multiplier.eq(Decimal.fromNumber(1))) return rate.mul(Decimal.fromNumber(elapsedSeconds));
  const lnMult = Math.log(multiplier.toNumber());
  return rate.mul(
    multiplier.pow(elapsedSeconds).sub(Decimal.fromNumber(1))
  ).div(Decimal.fromNumber(lnMult));
}
```

**For constant production (most common, simplest):**
```js
// If production per second is a fixed rate:
// offlineGain = rate * elapsedSeconds
// Apply this per resource type.
```

**Bounded simulation (when closed-form isn't possible):**
```js
function simulateOffline(gameState, elapsedSeconds, maxTicks = 1000) {
  const tickDuration = Math.max(elapsedSeconds / maxTicks, 1); // at least 1s per tick
  const ticks = Math.min(Math.ceil(elapsedSeconds / tickDuration), maxTicks);
  for (let i = 0; i < ticks; i++) {
    updateProduction(gameState, tickDuration); // same function as online tick
  }
  return gameState;
}
```

**Generous approximation principle:** Offline progress should be ≥ exact calculation, never less. Players return to a pleasant surprise (variable reward), not a disappointment. Cap offline earnings at 75-100% of theoretical max (the missing 0-25% accounts for upgrades the player *would have* bought).

**The "welcome back" screen:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   ⏰ You were away 6h 23m   │
│                             │
│   💰 Earned: 2.35e14 gold   │
│   ⬆ Production: +12%        │
│   🏆 3 milestones reached   │
│                             │
│      [ Collect & Continue ] │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```
This screen is a critical retention moment. Make it satisfying.

---

### E) Game Loop (Idle-Specific)

Idle games need a loop that handles three scenarios: (1) normal foreground play, (2) return from background with seconds-to-hours of catch-up, (3) initial load with save restoration.

```js
// === CORE GAME LOOP ===
const TICK_RATE = 1000 / 10; // 10 ticks/sec is plenty for idle games (saves battery)
let lastTimestamp = Date.now();
let accumulator = 0;
let saveTimer = 0;
const SAVE_INTERVAL = 30_000; // 30 seconds

function gameLoop() {
  const now = Date.now();
  let elapsed = now - lastTimestamp;
  lastTimestamp = now;

  // Cap frame delta to prevent spiral of death
  // But DON'T cap elapsed for offline — handle separately
  if (elapsed > 1000) {
    // Likely returning from background — handle as offline
    handleOfflineProgress(elapsed / 1000);
    elapsed = TICK_RATE; // process one normal tick this frame
  }

  accumulator += elapsed;

  // Fixed timestep simulation
  while (accumulator >= TICK_RATE) {
    updateGame(TICK_RATE / 1000); // pass dt in seconds
    accumulator -= TICK_RATE;
  }

  // Autosave
  saveTimer += elapsed;
  if (saveTimer >= SAVE_INTERVAL) {
    saveGame();
    saveTimer = 0;
  }

  renderGame(); // render at display refresh rate
  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}

// === VISIBILITY HANDLING (CRITICAL FOR MOBILE) ===
document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', () => {
  if (document.hidden) {
    // Going to background: save immediately + record timestamp
    saveGame();
    lastTimestamp = Date.now(); // will compute delta on return
  } else {
    // Returning to foreground: compute offline time
    const now = Date.now();
    const offlineSeconds = (now - lastTimestamp) / 1000;
    lastTimestamp = now;
    accumulator = 0;

    if (offlineSeconds > 5) { // only show welcome-back if meaningful
      handleOfflineProgress(offlineSeconds);
      showWelcomeBackScreen(offlineSeconds);
    }
  }
});

// === OFFLINE HANDLER ===
function handleOfflineProgress(seconds) {
  // For each resource with simple production:
  for (const resource of gameState.resources) {
    const gain = resource.productionPerSecond.mul(Decimal.fromNumber(seconds));
    resource.amount = resource.amount.add(gain);
  }

  // For complex systems: bounded simulation
  // simulateOffline(gameState, seconds, 1000);

  // Check milestones that may have been crossed
  checkMilestones();
}
```

**Critical mobile behaviors:**
- `requestAnimationFrame` is **fully paused** in background tabs (all browsers)
- `setTimeout/setInterval` throttled to ≥1s in background (Chrome), ≥1min after 5 min
- iOS Safari may **suspend the page entirely** after a few minutes — your only defense is saving before entering background
- `Date.now()` is the **only reliable time source** across tab states

---

### F) Number Notation & Formatting

**Notation tier system:**

| Range | Format | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 0 – 999 | Integer | `423` |
| 1,000 – 999,999 | With commas or K suffix | `42,300` or `42.3K` |
| 1e6 – 1e15 | Named suffix | `1.50M`, `2.30B`, `4.12T` |
| 1e15 – 1e33 | Extended suffix | `1.50Qa`, `2.30Qi`, ... |
| 1e33+ | Scientific | `2.35e42` |
| 1e1000+ | Engineering (optional) | `235.0e1000` |

**Suffix table:**
```js
const SUFFIXES = [
  '', 'K', 'M', 'B', 'T', 'Qa', 'Qi', 'Sx', 'Sp', 'Oc', 'No', 'Dc',
  'UDc', 'DDc', 'TDc', 'QaDc', 'QiDc', 'SxDc', 'SpDc', 'ODc', 'NDc', 'Vg'
];

function formatNumber(decimal, precision = 2) {
  if (decimal.lt(Decimal.fromNumber(1000))) {
    return decimal.toNumber() < 10
      ? decimal.toNumber().toFixed(precision)
      : Math.floor(decimal.toNumber()).toString();
  }

  const log = decimal.log10();
  const tier = Math.floor(log / 3);

  if (tier < SUFFIXES.length) {
    const scaled = decimal.div(Decimal.fromNumber(10 ** (tier * 3)));
    return scaled.toNumber().toFixed(precision) + SUFFIXES[tier];
  }

  // Scientific notation for very large
  return decimal.m.toFixed(precision) + 'e' + Math.floor(decimal.e);
}
```

**Contextual display (more important than raw formatting):**
Don't just show `Cost: 1.5e12`. Show relationship to what the player has:
```
Cost: 1.50T  (you have 2.30T)     ← affordable, show green
Cost: 1.50T  (you have 800B)      ← show progress bar at 53%
Cost: 1.50T  (≈ 4 min)            ← time estimate at current rate
```

The **time-to-afford estimate** is one of the highest-value UI elements in an idle game:
```js
function timeToAfford(cost, current, productionPerSecond) {
  if (current.gte(cost)) return 0;
  const remaining = cost.sub(current);
  return remaining.div(productionPerSecond).toNumber(); // seconds
}

function formatDuration(seconds) {
  if (seconds < 60)   return `${Math.ceil(seconds)}s`;
  if (seconds < 3600)  return `${Math.floor(seconds/60)}m ${Math.floor(seconds%60)}s`;
  if (seconds < 86400) return `${Math.floor(seconds/3600)}h ${Math.floor((seconds%3600)/60)}m`;
  return `${Math.floor(seconds/86400)}d ${Math.floor((seconds%86400)/3600)}h`;
}
```

**Notation is a design decision, not just formatting.** Offer player choice where appropriate (Settings: Short Scale / Scientific / Engineering). At minimum, be consistent within a context.

---

### G) Save / Load / Persistence

**Save only source of truth. Derive everything else.**

The save file stores: (1) amount of each resource, (2) count of each upgrade purchased, (3) prestige currencies, (4) timestamps, (5) settings/preferences. It does NOT store production rates, display values, formatted strings, or any derived quantity. On load, recalculate everything from the saved base data.

```js
// === SAVE SYSTEM ===
function buildSaveData() {
  return {
    v: SAVE_VERSION,  // for migration
    t: Date.now(),    // save timestamp
    resources: gameState.resources.map(r => ({
      id: r.id,
      amount: r.amount.toString(), // serialize Decimal as string
    })),
    upgrades: gameState.upgrades.map(u => ({
      id: u.id,
      count: u.count,
    })),
    prestige: {
      currency: gameState.prestige.currency.toString(),
      count: gameState.prestige.timesPrestiged,
    },
    stats: {
      totalEarned: gameState.totalEarned.toString(),
      playTime: gameState.playTime,
    },
  };
}

function saveGame() {
  try {
    const data = JSON.stringify(buildSaveData());
    const compressed = LZString.compressToUTF16(data);
    localStorage.setItem('idle_save', compressed);
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('Save failed:', e);
    // localStorage might be full or disabled — degrade gracefully
  }
}

function loadGame() {
  try {
    const compressed = localStorage.getItem('idle_save');
    if (!compressed) return null;
    const data = JSON.parse(LZString.decompressFromUTF16(compressed));
    if (data.v !== SAVE_VERSION) return migrateSave(data);
    return data;
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('Load failed:', e);
    return null;
  }
}
```

**Export/import for manual backup (mandatory on mobile):**
```js
function exportSave() {
  const data = JSON.stringify(buildSaveData());
  return LZString.compressToEncodedURIComponent(data);
  // Display as copyable string or share sheet
}

function importSave(str) {
  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(LZString.decompressFromEncodedURIComponent(str));
    // Validate structure before applying
    if (!data.v || !data.resources) throw new Error('Invalid save');
    applySaveData(data);
    return true;
  } catch (e) {
    return false;
  }
}
```

**iOS storage eviction risk:** Safari may evict localStorage under memory pressure. Mitigate by: (1) prompting players to export periodically, (2) keeping save data small via compression, (3) considering IndexedDB as fallback (larger quota, but async API).

**Basic tamper detection (optional but recommended):**
```js
function checksumSave(data) {
  const str = JSON.stringify(data);
  let hash = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + str.charCodeAt(i);
    hash |= 0;
  }
  return hash;
}
```
This won't stop determined cheaters but catches casual localStorage edits.

---

### H) Mobile-Specific Engineering

**Touch optimization:**
```css
/* Kill the 300ms tap delay (CRITICAL) */
* { touch-action: manipulation; }

/* Prevent text selection on game elements */
.game-ui { user-select: none; -webkit-user-select: none; }

/* Touch targets: minimum 48×48 CSS px */
.upgrade-button { min-height: 48px; min-width: 48px; padding: 12px; }
```

**Event handling:**
```js
// Use passive listeners for scroll-heavy areas
element.addEventListener('touchmove', handler, { passive: true });

// Debounce rapid tapping (for active clicker phase)
let lastTap = 0;
function onTap(e) {
  const now = performance.now();
  if (now - lastTap < 50) return; // 50ms debounce
  lastTap = now;
  processClick(e);
}
```

**Render budget:**
- Target **30fps** for idle games (saves ~50% battery vs 60fps)
- Use `canvas` for animated elements, DOM for persistent UI (upgrade lists, resource displays)
- Only repaint what changed — idle games have mostly static screens with periodic number updates
- `transform` and `opacity` are the only CSS properties that animate without triggering layout

**Battery-conscious design:**
```js
// Reduce tick rate when nothing interesting is happening
function adaptiveTickRate() {
  const hasActiveAnimations = particles.length > 0 || activeTweens.length > 0;
  const playerIsActive = (Date.now() - lastInteraction) < 5000;

  if (playerIsActive || hasActiveAnimations) return 1000 / 30; // 30fps
  return 1000 / 4; // 4fps when idle — just updating numbers
}
```

**Progressive UI disclosure:**
Don't show all systems on first load. Unlock UI sections as the player progresses:
```js
const UI_UNLOCKS = [
  { id: 'generators',   condition: () => true },                          // always visible
  { id: 'upgrades',     condition: () => gameState.totalEarned.gte(100) },
  { id: 'multipliers',  condition: () => gameState.generators[0].count >= 10 },
  { id: 'prestige',     condition: () => calcPrestigeCurrency(gameState.totalEarned).gte(1) },
  { id: 'automation',   condition: () => gameState.prestige.count >= 1 },
  { id: 'achievements', condition: () => gameState.achievements.length > 0 },
];
```

## Quick Reference: Common Economy Recipes

### Simple clicker (Cookie Clicker style)
```
Resources: 1 (cookies)
Generators: 5-10 types, each producing cookies/sec
Cost ratio: 1.15 per generator
Production: each generator type ~10× more productive than previous
First prestige: ~1e8 cookies (45-60 min)
Prestige bonus: multiplier to all production
```

### Multi-resource (Adventure Capitalist style)
```
Resources: 5-10 independent businesses
Generators: each resource has its own generator chain
Cost ratio: 1.07-1.10 (faster since multiple resources compete for attention)
Managers: auto-collect, unlocked at milestones
First prestige: when all businesses reach threshold
Prestige bonus: global multiplier per angel investor (log-based)
```

### Deep prestige (Antimatter Dimensions style)
```
Resources: primary + 8+ dimension tiers
Generators: each dimension produces the one below it
Cost ratio: varies by dimension (1.5-1e8)
Prestige layers: 3+ (infinity → eternity → reality)
Each layer: new currency, new upgrade tree, new mechanics
Notation: player-selectable (scientific, engineering, logarithmic)

## The Idle Checklist (Ship Gate)

### Math & precision
- [ ] Game values use big number library (not raw Number for unbounded values)
- [ ] Buy-max uses closed-form formula
- [ ] Cost display matches actual deduction (no rounding mismatch)
- [ ] Production calculation is deterministic and order-stable

### Economy & pacing
- [ ] Something is affordable within 10 minutes at any point
- [ ] First prestige reachable in 45-90 minutes of active play
- [ ] Prestige preview clearly shows what you'll gain
- [ ] OoM/min rate stays within target band per phase
- [ ] Each prestige layer introduces a new decision

### Offline & persistence
- [ ] Page Visibility triggers save + timestamp
- [ ] Autosave every 30 seconds
- [ ] Offline progress computed in <500ms (even for 24h absence)
- [ ] "Welcome back" screen shows earnings
- [ ] Export/import available for manual backup
- [ ] Save data survives app restart / browser clear (within platform limits)

### Mobile & UX
- [ ] `touch-action: manipulation` applied (no 300ms delay)
- [ ] Touch targets ≥ 48×48 CSS px
- [ ] Number formatting uses appropriate notation tier
- [ ] Progress bars are log-scaled
- [ ] UI unlocks progressively (no information overload)
- [ ] Battery-conscious render rate (30fps or adaptive)

### Robustness
- [ ] No NaN/Infinity displayed to player (catch and handle)
- [ ] Save migration handles old versions
- [ ] Offline progress is generous (≥ exact, never less)
- [ ] Time-to-afford estimate shown for unaffordable items
