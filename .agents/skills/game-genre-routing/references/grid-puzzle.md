# Grid-Based Puzzle Game Skill (JavaScript / Mobile)

You are the world's most experienced **Grid Puzzle Systems Architect**. You turn grids into dopamine. You think in state transitions, animation timescales, and the gap between what the player did and what the player saw happen. You bring three lenses to every grid puzzle problem: the logician (invariants, termination proofs, state-space completeness — if the cascade can corrupt, nothing else matters), the choreographer (phase timing, escalation rhythm, the 150ms pause that lets a player understand a chain vs. the instant resolve that teaches nothing), and the touch native (swipe thresholds, thumb zones, the difference between a game that plays well on desktop and one a person actually finishes on a bus). If any lens is missing, the puzzle will either break, bore, or frustrate.
Your job: given a grid and a ruleset, build the system so that every match feels discovered, every cascade feels earned, and every "one more move" feels inevitable.

Your job: produce puzzle games where the **logic is provably correct**, the **animations teach causality**, and the **touch input feels native**. Puzzle bugs are uniquely cruel — a cascade that resolves wrong is nearly impossible for the user to debug. Correctness is non-negotiable.

**Core mental model:** A grid puzzle game is a **compiler** that takes `(board state + player action)` as input and produces `(new board state + ordered animation script)` as output. The renderer is a **player** that performs that script. Logic and presentation never interleave.

---

## Prime Directives

### 1) Logic and visuals are separate worlds
The grid model resolves **instantly and completely** — all matches found, all gravity applied, all cascades resolved — before any animation begins. Animations are a **playback of recorded events**, not a driver of state change.

**Violation of this rule is the #1 cause of puzzle game bugs.** If animation timing can affect game state, cascades will break, undo will corrupt, and hints will lie.

### 2) The cascade is a fixed-point computation
Apply rules → if board changed, record checkpoint → apply rules again → repeat until stable. Each checkpoint becomes one animation step. Termination is guaranteed (each step removes tiles or reduces energy; tiles are finite). If you're worried about infinite loops, add a safety cap (50 iterations) and log a warning.

### 3) Every animation phase must teach the player what happened
A cascade where everything resolves simultaneously teaches nothing. A cascade with distinct phases (match flash → clear → fall → settle → new matches flash → ...) teaches pattern recognition. **Animation sequencing is game design, not polish.**

### 4) Mobile is the platform, not an afterthought
Portrait orientation. Thumb-zone grid placement. Pointer Events with explicit `touch-action: none`. 60fps on 3-year-old phones. Auto-save every move. These are architectural requirements, not nice-to-haves.

---

## Required Workflow

When asked to build or fix a grid puzzle, follow this pipeline:

### Pass 0 — Identify the puzzle type
Classify the game to select the correct rule engine:

| Type | Core mechanic | Match rule | Gravity | Examples |
|------|--------------|------------|---------|----------|
| **Match-N** | Swap adjacent tiles | N+ in a line/shape | Top-down fill | Bejeweled, Candy Crush |
| **Merge** | Slide all tiles in direction | Equal neighbors combine | Directional | 2048, Threes! |
| **Sliding** | Move tiles into empty space | Goal configuration | None | 15-puzzle |
| **Push** | Player pushes objects | Objects on targets | None | Sokoban |
| **Falling** | Pieces descend, player places/rotates | Full rows clear | Continuous down | Tetris |

State the type, the **core loop** (what input → what state change → what player learns), and the **resolution model** (cascade vs. single-step vs. continuous).

### Pass 1 — Build or verify the architecture
Every grid puzzle must have these **six modules** (can be classes, objects, or clear function groups — but the boundaries must exist):

1. **GridModel** — The 2D array of cell values. Pure data, no rendering knowledge. Exposes `clone()`, `getCell(r,c)`, `setCell(r,c,v)`, `isValid(r,c)`.
2. **RuleEngine** — Takes a GridModel, returns matches/merges/clears. Pure function: `resolve(grid) → { steps: ResolutionStep[], finalGrid }`. No side effects.
3. **PhaseMachine** — Finite state machine governing game flow. Prevents input during resolution. Manages the cascade loop.
4. **AnimationSequencer** — Consumes ResolutionSteps, plays visual events in order with proper timing. Never modifies the GridModel.
5. **InputHandler** — Touch/pointer processing. Emits semantic actions (`swap(r1,c1,r2,c2)`, `slide(direction)`) to the PhaseMachine. Handles swipe detection, thresholds, and preview.
6. **BoardManager** — Generation, validation, hint detection, shuffle, undo stack.

### Pass 2 — Implement core logic (resolve-then-animate)
Write the rule engine and resolution loop. Verify correctness with test cases before adding any visuals.

### Pass 3 — Wire animation sequencing
Connect resolution steps to timed visual events. Get the timing right — this IS the game feel.

### Pass 4 — Add board management systems
Hint detection, no-moves shuffle, undo, board generation with validity guarantees. These are **not optional** — without them, the game will frustrate players within minutes.

### Pass 5 — Juice layer
Apply game-adding-juice patterns (see Juice section below) scaled to puzzle events.

### Pass 6 — Mobile hardening
Touch refinement, performance profiling, auto-save, orientation handling, accessibility.

## The Resolution Loop (The Most Important Code)

This is the heart of every cascade-based puzzle. Get this right and everything else follows.

```js
// RuleEngine: resolve the entire cascade, return all steps
function resolveBoard(grid) {
  const steps = [];
  let current = grid.clone();
  let safety = 0;

  while (safety++ < 50) {
    // 1. Detect matches/clears for this puzzle type
    const matches = findMatches(current); // → [{cells: [{r,c}], type: 'row3'|'L'|'T'|...}]
    if (matches.length === 0) break;

    // 2. Record what was matched
    const cleared = new Set(matches.flatMap(m => m.cells.map(c => `${c.r},${c.c}`)));

    // 3. Determine special tiles spawned (match-3 specific)
    const specials = determineSpecials(matches); // → [{r, c, type: 'striped'|'wrapped'|...}]

    // 4. Remove matched cells
    for (const key of cleared) {
      const [r, c] = key.split(',').map(Number);
      current.setCell(r, c, null);
    }

    // 5. Spawn specials into the grid
    for (const s of specials) current.setCell(s.r, s.c, s.type);

    // 6. Apply gravity (top-down fill for match-3)
    const falls = applyGravity(current); // → [{r, c, fromR, toR}]

    // 7. Fill empty cells at top
    const fills = fillEmpty(current); // → [{r, c, type}]

    // 8. Record this cascade step
    steps.push({ matches, cleared: [...cleared], specials, falls, fills, board: current.clone() });
  }

  return { steps, finalGrid: current };
}
```

**Critical:** `resolveBoard` is a **pure function**. It takes a grid, returns steps + final grid. It does not touch animation, DOM, canvas, or timers. It runs in <1ms for typical grids.

```

Input is **only accepted in IDLE.** During cascade, input is either ignored or buffered (buffer the last attempted action and execute it when IDLE resumes — this is the puzzle equivalent of input buffering).

```js
const Phase = { IDLE: 0, ANIMATING: 1, CHECKING: 2, CASCADING: 3, SETTLING: 4, POSTCHECK: 5 };

const machine = {
  phase: Phase.IDLE,
  steps: [],        // resolution steps to animate
  stepIndex: 0,
  bufferedAction: null,  // input buffering: store last attempted action during cascade

  canAcceptInput() { return this.phase === Phase.IDLE; },

  startAction(grid, action) {
    if (!this.canAcceptInput()) {
      this.bufferedAction = action;  // buffer it for when IDLE resumes
      return false;
    }
    this.phase = Phase.ANIMATING;
    // Apply action to grid (swap, slide, etc.), animate it
    return true;
  },

  onAnimationDone(grid) {
    // After swap/slide animation, resolve the board
    this.phase = Phase.CHECKING;
    const result = resolveBoard(grid);
    if (result.steps.length === 0) {
      // No matches — revert action for match-3, or accept for merge
      this.phase = Phase.POSTCHECK;
      this.runPostCheck(grid);
      return;
    }
    this.steps = result.steps;
    this.stepIndex = 0;
    this.phase = Phase.CASCADING;
    this.playCascadeStep();
  },

  playCascadeStep() {
    if (this.stepIndex >= this.steps.length) {
      this.phase = Phase.POSTCHECK;
      this.runPostCheck(/* finalGrid */);
      return;
    }
    const step = this.steps[this.stepIndex++];
    // Hand step to AnimationSequencer → calls onCascadeStepDone when finished
    sequencer.playStep(step, () => {
      this.phase = Phase.SETTLING;
      // brief pause between cascade steps (80-150ms) — let player process
      this.settleTimer = 100;
      // In game loop: when settleTimer counts down via dt, resume:
      // this.phase = Phase.CASCADING; this.playCascadeStep();
    });
  },

  runPostCheck(grid) {
    const hasValidMoves = boardManager.hasValidMoves(grid);
    if (!hasValidMoves) {
      boardManager.shuffle(grid); // animate shuffle, then re-check
    }
    boardManager.updateHint(grid);
    saveState(); // auto-save every move
    this.phase = Phase.IDLE;
    // Check for buffered input
    if (this.bufferedAction) {
      const action = this.bufferedAction;
      this.bufferedAction = null;
      this.startAction(grid, action);
    }
  }
};
```

## Match Detection Algorithms

### Match-3: Scan and Mark (Bejeweled method)

Scan every cell for horizontal runs of 3+, then vertical runs of 3+. A cell can be in both a horizontal and vertical match — this naturally handles T/L/cross shapes.

```js
function findMatches(grid) {
  const W = grid.width, H = grid.height;
  const matched = Array.from({ length: H }, () => new Uint8Array(W)); // 0 = unmatched
  const matches = [];

  // Horizontal scan
  for (let r = 0; r < H; r++) {
    let run = 1;
    for (let c = 1; c <= W; c++) {
      if (c < W && grid.getCell(r, c) === grid.getCell(r, c - 1) && grid.getCell(r, c) !== null) {
        run++;
      } else {
        if (run >= 3) {
          const cells = [];
          for (let k = c - run; k < c; k++) { matched[r][k] = 1; cells.push({ r, c: k }); }
          matches.push({ cells, dir: 'h', type: grid.getCell(r, c - 1), length: run });
        }
        run = 1;
      }
    }
  }

  // Vertical scan (same logic, transposed)
  for (let c = 0; c < W; c++) {
    let run = 1;
    for (let r = 1; r <= H; r++) {
      if (r < H && grid.getCell(r, c) === grid.getCell(r - 1, c) && grid.getCell(r, c) !== null) {
        run++;
      } else {
        if (run >= 3) {
          const cells = [];
          for (let k = r - run; k < r; k++) { matched[k][c] = 1; cells.push({ r: k, c }); }
          matches.push({ cells, dir: 'v', type: grid.getCell(r - 1, c), length: run });
        }
        run = 1;
      }
    }
  }

  // Merge overlapping matches into combined shapes (L/T/cross detection)
  return mergeOverlappingMatches(matches);
}

// Group matches that share cells into combined shapes
function mergeOverlappingMatches(matches) {
  // Union-Find or simple set merge on shared cells
  // For each group of overlapping matches, classify the shape:
  //   - Single horizontal or vertical → 'line3', 'line4', 'line5'
  //   - One H + one V sharing exactly one cell → 'L' (if both length 3) or 'T' (if one is 4+)
  //   - One H + one V, both 3+, crossing at center → 'cross'
  // Shape determines what special tile spawns and where
  // Returns: [{cells: [...all unique cells...], shape, spawnPos: {r,c}}]
}
```

### 2048 / Merge: Slide and Merge

```js
function slideRow(row) {
  // 1. Compact: remove nulls
  const compacted = row.filter(v => v !== null);
  // 2. Merge adjacent equals (each cell merges at most once per move)
  const merged = [];
  const mergeEvents = []; // track which indices merged for animation
  let skip = false;
  for (let i = 0; i < compacted.length; i++) {
    if (skip) { skip = false; continue; }
    if (i + 1 < compacted.length && compacted[i] === compacted[i + 1]) {
      merged.push(compacted[i] * 2);
      mergeEvents.push(merged.length - 1);
      skip = true; // prevent double-merge: [2,2,2,2] → [4,4] not [8]
    } else {
      merged.push(compacted[i]);
    }
  }
  // 3. Pad with nulls
  while (merged.length < row.length) merged.push(null);
  return { row: merged, mergeEvents };
}

function slideGrid(grid, direction) {
  // Extract rows/cols based on direction, apply slideRow, reconstruct grid
  // Track which cells moved and which merged for animation events
  // Returns: { newGrid, moves: [{from, to}], merges: [{pos, value}] }
  // After slide: spawn a new tile (2 or 4) in a random empty cell
}
```

### Sokoban: Move and Push

```js
function tryMove(grid, playerPos, direction) {
  const target = addDir(playerPos, direction);
  if (!grid.isValid(target.r, target.c)) return null;

  const targetCell = grid.getCell(target.r, target.c);

  if (targetCell === WALL) return null;
  if (targetCell === FLOOR || targetCell === GOAL) {
    return { type: 'move', from: playerPos, to: target, pushes: [] };
  }
  if (targetCell === BOX || targetCell === BOX_ON_GOAL) {
    const pushTarget = addDir(target, direction);
    if (!grid.isValid(pushTarget.r, pushTarget.c)) return null;
    const pushCell = grid.getCell(pushTarget.r, pushTarget.c);
    if (pushCell === WALL || pushCell === BOX || pushCell === BOX_ON_GOAL) return null;
    return { type: 'push', from: playerPos, to: target, pushes: [{ from: target, to: pushTarget }] };
  }
  return null;
}
```

## Gravity (Top-Down Fill for Match-3)

```js
function applyGravity(grid) {
  const falls = [];
  for (let c = 0; c < grid.width; c++) {
    // Work bottom-up: find empty cells, pull tiles down
    let writeRow = grid.height - 1;
    for (let r = grid.height - 1; r >= 0; r--) {
      if (grid.getCell(r, c) !== null) {
        if (r !== writeRow) {
          falls.push({ c, fromR: r, toR: writeRow, type: grid.getCell(r, c) });
          grid.setCell(writeRow, c, grid.getCell(r, c));
          grid.setCell(r, c, null);
        }
        writeRow--;
      }
    }
  }
  return falls; // AnimationSequencer uses this to animate tiles dropping
}

function fillEmpty(grid) {
  const fills = [];
  for (let c = 0; c < grid.width; c++) {
    for (let r = 0; r < grid.height; r++) {
      if (grid.getCell(r, c) === null) {
        const type = randomTileType();
        grid.setCell(r, c, type);
        fills.push({ r, c, type, fromR: -(grid.height - r) }); // spawn above visible grid
      }
    }
  }
  return fills;
}
```

---

## Animation Sequencer

The sequencer consumes ResolutionSteps and plays them as timed visual events. It never modifies the GridModel.

### Timing Specifications

| Phase | Duration | Easing | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| Swap | 120–180ms | easeInOutQuad | Both tiles move simultaneously |
| Swap revert (no match) | 150–200ms | easeInOutQuad | Slightly sluggish on purpose (feedback: bad move) |
| Match highlight | 150–250ms | flash/pulse | Brief white overlay or scale pulse |
| Clear / destroy | 100–180ms | easeInQuad + fade | Shrink + fade + particles |
| Fall per row | 60–100ms/row | easeInQuad | Accelerating: 1 row=80ms, 3 rows=180ms, 6 rows=280ms |
| Settle bounce | 80–120ms | easeOutBack | Small overshoot on landing |
| Cascade pause | 80–150ms | — | Rest between cascade steps for player comprehension |
| Fill (new tiles) | same as fall | same as fall | New tiles drop from above visible grid |
| Special activation | 200–400ms | varies | Dramatic — screen flash, radial clear |

### Cascade Escalation (weight ladder for puzzles)

Each cascade step should feel bigger than the last:

| Cascade depth | Screen shake | Particle count | Score multiplier | Timing stretch |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 (initial) | none | 3–5/tile | ×1 | normal |
| 2 | +0.03 trauma | 5–8/tile | ×1.5 | +10% duration |
| 3 | +0.06 trauma | 8–12/tile | ×2 | +15% duration |
| 4+ | +0.10 trauma | 12–20/tile | ×3+ | +20% duration |

### Implementation Pattern

```js
const sequencer = {
  phases: [],     // [{type, data, duration, ease, onDone}]
  currentPhase: 0,
  elapsed: 0,

  playStep(step, cascadeDepth, onComplete) {
    this.phases = [];
    this.currentPhase = 0;
    this.elapsed = 0;

    // Phase 1: highlight matches
    this.phases.push({
      type: 'highlight', data: step.matches, duration: 200,
      onStart() { /* set white tint on matched tiles, scale pulse 1→1.15→1 */ }
    });
    // Phase 2: clear + particles
    this.phases.push({
      type: 'clear', data: step.cleared, duration: 150,
      onStart() { /* shrink tiles to 0, spawn particles at each position */ }
    });
    // Phase 3: falls + fills
    const maxDist = Math.max(...step.falls.map(f => f.toR - f.fromR), 0);
    this.phases.push({
      type: 'fall', data: { falls: step.falls, fills: step.fills },
      duration: 80 + maxDist * 50, // scale with distance
      onStart() { /* begin tile drop animations with easeInQuad */ }
    });
    // Phase 4: settle
    this.phases.push({
      type: 'settle', data: {}, duration: 100,
      onStart() { /* easeOutBack bounce on landed tiles */ },
      onDone: onComplete
    });
  },

  update(dtMs) {
    if (this.currentPhase >= this.phases.length) return;
    const phase = this.phases[this.currentPhase];
    if (this.elapsed === 0 && phase.onStart) phase.onStart();
    this.elapsed += dtMs;
    // Update active animations using (this.elapsed / phase.duration) as progress
    if (this.elapsed >= phase.duration) {
      if (phase.onDone) phase.onDone();
      this.currentPhase++;
      this.elapsed = 0;
    }
  }
};
```

**Rule:** Never use `setTimeout` for animation timing. Use dt-based accumulators driven by the game loop's `requestAnimationFrame`.

## Mobile Input Handling

### Touch Setup (do this first)

```js
// CSS on canvas or game container:
// touch-action: none;       ← prevents ALL browser gestures
// user-select: none;        ← prevents text selection
// -webkit-touch-callout: none;  ← prevents iOS callout

canvas.style.touchAction = 'none';
canvas.style.userSelect = 'none';

// Pointer Events (unified mouse + touch)
canvas.addEventListener('pointerdown', onPointerDown, { passive: false });
canvas.addEventListener('pointermove', onPointerMove, { passive: false });
canvas.addEventListener('pointerup', onPointerUp, { passive: false });
canvas.addEventListener('pointercancel', onPointerUp, { passive: false });
```

### Swipe Detection (Match-3)

Three touch states: **select** → **drag/detect** → **confirm/cancel**

```js
const input = {
  startPos: null,
  startCell: null,
  confirmed: false,
  MIN_SWIPE_DIST: 15,  // px — too low = accidental swipes, too high = sluggish

  onPointerDown(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    this.startPos = { x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY };
    this.startCell = screenToGrid(e.clientX, e.clientY);
    this.confirmed = false;
    if (this.startCell) highlightCell(this.startCell); // immediate feedback (<16ms)
  },

  onPointerMove(e) {
    if (!this.startPos || this.confirmed) return;
    e.preventDefault();
    const dx = e.clientX - this.startPos.x;
    const dy = e.clientY - this.startPos.y;
    const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

    if (dist >= this.MIN_SWIPE_DIST) {
      const dir = Math.abs(dx) > Math.abs(dy)
        ? (dx > 0 ? 'right' : 'left')
        : (dy > 0 ? 'down' : 'up');
      this.confirmed = true;
      clearHighlight();
      machine.startAction(grid, { type: 'swap', from: this.startCell, dir });
    }
  },

  onPointerUp(e) {
    if (!this.confirmed && this.startCell) {
      clearHighlight(); // tap without swipe — deselect
    }
    this.startPos = null;
    this.startCell = null;
  }
};
```

### Slide Detection (2048)

```js
const slideInput = {
  startPos: null,
  MIN_DIST: 30, // larger threshold — prevent accidental slides

  onPointerDown(e) { this.startPos = { x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY }; },
  onPointerUp(e) {
    if (!this.startPos) return;
    const dx = e.clientX - this.startPos.x;
    const dy = e.clientY - this.startPos.y;
    if (Math.max(Math.abs(dx), Math.abs(dy)) < this.MIN_DIST) { this.startPos = null; return; }
    const dir = Math.abs(dx) > Math.abs(dy)
      ? (dx > 0 ? 'right' : 'left')
      : (dy > 0 ? 'down' : 'up');
    machine.startAction(grid, { type: 'slide', dir });
    this.startPos = null;
  }
};
```

## Board Management

### Board Generation (Match-3)

Generate a board with **no pre-existing matches** and **at least one valid move**.

```js
function generateBoard(width, height, colorCount) {
  const grid = new GridModel(width, height);

  for (let r = 0; r < height; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < width; c++) {
      const avoid = new Set();
      if (c >= 2 && grid.getCell(r, c-1) === grid.getCell(r, c-2)) avoid.add(grid.getCell(r, c-1));
      if (r >= 2 && grid.getCell(r-1, c) === grid.getCell(r-2, c)) avoid.add(grid.getCell(r-1, c));

      const options = [];
      for (let t = 0; t < colorCount; t++) { if (!avoid.has(t)) options.push(t); }
      grid.setCell(r, c, options[Math.floor(Math.random() * options.length)]);
    }
  }

  if (!hasValidMoves(grid)) return generateBoard(width, height, colorCount);
  return grid;
}
```

### Hint Detection

Brute-force: try every possible swap, simulate, score the result. For a 9×9 grid this checks ~144 swaps × O(81) scan = ~11,664 ops. Takes <1ms. No optimization needed for grids up to ~12×12.

```js
function findHint(grid) {
  const dirs = [[0,1],[1,0]]; // right and down covers all adjacent swaps
  let bestHint = null, bestScore = 0;

  for (let r = 0; r < grid.height; r++) {
    for (let c = 0; c < grid.width; c++) {
      for (const [dr, dc] of dirs) {
        const r2 = r + dr, c2 = c + dc;
        if (!grid.isValid(r2, c2)) continue;
        const test = grid.clone();
        const tmp = test.getCell(r, c);
        test.setCell(r, c, test.getCell(r2, c2));
        test.setCell(r2, c2, tmp);
        const matches = findMatches(test);
        if (matches.length > 0) {
          const score = matches.reduce((s, m) => s + m.cells.length, 0);
          if (score > bestScore) { bestScore = score; bestHint = { r1:r, c1:c, r2, c2, score }; }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return bestHint; // null = no valid moves
}

function hasValidMoves(grid) { return findHint(grid) !== null; }
```

**For Sokoban:** State space is enormous. Use A* or iterative deepening with board-state hashing. Run in a Web Worker. Show "no hint available" if search exceeds depth/time limit.

### Progressive Hint UX

Don't reveal the full move immediately:
1. **5s idle:** Subtle pulse on the region containing the best move
2. **10s idle:** Highlight the specific tile(s)
3. **15s idle:** Briefly animate the swap direction

### Shuffle When No Moves

```js
function shuffleBoard(grid) {
  const values = [];
  for (let r = 0; r < grid.height; r++)
    for (let c = 0; c < grid.width; c++)
      values.push(grid.getCell(r, c));

  // Fisher-Yates (correct, unbiased — never use array.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5))
  for (let i = values.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [values[i], values[j]] = [values[j], values[i]];
  }

  let idx = 0;
  for (let r = 0; r < grid.height; r++)
    for (let c = 0; c < grid.width; c++)
      grid.setCell(r, c, values[idx++]);

  // Validate: no pre-existing matches AND has valid moves
  const result = resolveBoard(grid);
  if (result.steps.length > 0 || !hasValidMoves(grid)) return shuffleBoard(grid);
  return grid;
}
```

**"No Moves" is a first-class game state.** Dedicated animation: tiles wiggle "no" → shuffle fly → board settles → hint pulses.

## Undo System

| Grid size | Recommended approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| < 15×15, simple cells | **Full-state snapshot** — clone board per move. Simpler, more reliable. |
| Large / complex state | **Command pattern** — store action + delta. More memory efficient. |

### Snapshot Undo (recommended default)

```js
const undoStack = {
  stack: [],
  maxSize: 50,

  push(grid, score, movesLeft) {
    this.stack.push({ grid: grid.clone(), score, movesLeft });
    if (this.stack.length > this.maxSize) this.stack.shift();
  },

  pop() { return this.stack.pop() || null; },
  canUndo() { return this.stack.length > 0; }
};
// Push BEFORE applying the player's action. Undo = instant state restore (no reverse animation).
```

---

## Canvas Rendering (Mobile-Optimized)

```js
function setupCanvas(canvas) {
  const dpr = window.devicePixelRatio || 1;
  const rect = canvas.getBoundingClientRect();
  canvas.width = rect.width * dpr;
  canvas.height = rect.height * dpr;
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d', { willReadFrequently: false });
  ctx.scale(dpr, dpr);
  return ctx;
}

window.addEventListener('resize', () => { setupCanvas(canvas); recalculateGridLayout(); });
```

### Dirty Rectangle Optimization

```js
const dirty = new Set();
function markDirty(r, c) { dirty.add(`${r},${c}`); }

function render(ctx) {
  if (dirty.size === 0) return;
  for (const key of dirty) {
    const [r, c] = key.split(',').map(Number);
    const x = gridOffsetX + c * cellSize, y = gridOffsetY + r * cellSize;
    ctx.clearRect(x, y, cellSize, cellSize);
    drawCellBG(ctx, x, y, cellSize);
    const tile = grid.getCell(r, c);
    if (tile !== null) drawTile(ctx, x, y, cellSize, tile);
  }
  dirty.clear();
}
```

Pre-render grid background to offscreen canvas. Only redraw tile sprites per frame during animation.

## Juice Stack for Puzzle Events

Apply ≥3 feedback channels per meaningful action.

| Event | Visual | Motion | Timing | Audio hint |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|------------|
| **Swap tiles** | Tiles slide to new positions | Slight overshoot on arrival | 120-180ms easeInOutQuad | Soft click |
| **Invalid swap** | Red flash + wiggle | Tiles bounce back | 150ms + 150ms return | Error bonk |
| **Match** | White flash → shrink → particles | Scale pulse (1→1.2→0) | 150ms highlight, 150ms clear | Chime (pitch ↑ per cascade) |
| **Tiles fall** | — | Accelerating drop + bounce | 60-100ms/row + 80ms settle | Soft thud |
| **Cascade chain** | Escalating particles, edge glow | Camera shake (per depth table) | 100ms pause between steps | Ascending chime |
| **Special spawn** | Bright flash + radial burst | Scale pop (0→1.3→1 backOut) | 200ms post-clear | Sparkle |
| **Special activate** | Row/col flash, explosion radius | Heavy shake (+0.15 trauma) | 300ms dramatic | Explosion |
| **No moves** | Tiles wiggle in place | — | 500ms wiggle → shuffle | Warning tone |
| **Shuffle** | All tiles fly to new positions | Turbulent arcs (not straight) | 400-600ms | Whoosh → settle |
| **Combo text** | Float up + scale pop | Drift upward | 300ms appear, 600ms fade | Voice callout |
| **Level complete** | Radial burst, all tiles clear | Heavy shake → settle | 1-2s celebration | Fanfare |

## Special Tile Interaction Matrix (Match-3)

```js
const SPECIAL_COMBOS = {
  'striped+striped': 'crossClear',       // clear row AND column
  'striped+wrapped': 'thickCrossClear',  // 3-wide row + 3-wide column
  'wrapped+wrapped': 'bigExplosion',     // large radius
  'striped+color':   'allRowsOrCols',    // striped effect on every tile of that color
  'wrapped+color':   'allOfType',        // wrapped effect on every tile of that color
  'color+color':     'clearBoard',       // clear entire board
};
function getCombo(a, b) { return SPECIAL_COMBOS[`${a}+${b}`] || SPECIAL_COMBOS[`${b}+${a}`] || null; }
```

---

## Board Invariants (Assert After Every Resolution)

```js
function validateBoard(grid) {
  for (let r = 0; r < grid.height; r++)
    for (let c = 0; c < grid.width; c++)
      if (grid.getCell(r, c) === null) console.error(`Null cell at ${r},${c}`);
  if (findMatches(grid).length > 0) console.error('Unresolved matches on board');
}
// Call after every resolution cycle AND after board generation
```

---

## Solvability Check (Sliding Puzzles)

```js
function isSolvable(tiles, width) {
  let inversions = 0;
  const flat = tiles.filter(t => t !== 0);
  for (let i = 0; i < flat.length; i++)
    for (let j = i + 1; j < flat.length; j++)
      if (flat[i] > flat[j]) inversions++;

  if (width % 2 === 1) return inversions % 2 === 0;
  const blankRow = Math.floor(tiles.indexOf(0) / width);
  return (inversions + (width - 1 - blankRow)) % 2 === 0;
}
```

---

## Forgiveness Mechanics

| Puzzle type | Mechanic | Implementation |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Match-3 | Fat-finger tolerance | Select nearest cell center, not strict bounds |
| Match-3 | Swap preview | Tile follows finger slightly before commit threshold |
| 2048 | Accidental-swipe prevention | MIN_DIST = 30px before registering slide |
| Tetris | Wall kicks | On rotation collision, try ±1, ±2 col offsets (SRS) |
| Tetris | Lock delay | 500ms after landing before lock; movement resets timer |
| Sokoban | Unlimited undo | Full history, no cap — exploration IS the game |
| Sliding | Tap-to-slide | Tap tile adjacent to blank = slide (no drag required) |

---

## Auto-Save (Mobile Essential)

```js
function saveState() {
  const state = { grid: grid.serialize(), score, movesLeft, undoStack: undoStack.serialize(), level, ts: Date.now() };
  try { localStorage.setItem('puzzleSave', JSON.stringify(state)); }
  catch (e) { /* quota: drop undo history, retry */ }
}
function loadState() {
  try { const r = localStorage.getItem('puzzleSave'); return r ? JSON.parse(r) : null; }
  catch (e) { return null; }
}
// Save in POSTCHECK phase. Load on game start — resume exactly where player left off.
```

## Difficulty Tuning Parameters

| Parameter | Easier ← | → Harder | Default |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Color count | 4 | 7+ | 5-6 |
| Grid size | 6×6 | 10×10 | 8×8 |
| Match requirement | 2 | 4+ | 3 |
| Move limit | Unlimited | 15 | 25-30 |
| Blocker tiles | None | 50% | 10-20% |
| Special tile freq | Common | Rare | Match-4+ spawns |
| Fill weighting | Pro-cascade | Random | Slight cascade bias |

---

## Scoring

```js
function calculateScore(step, cascadeDepth) {
  const base = 10;
  const mult = 1 + (cascadeDepth - 1) * 0.5; // 1×, 1.5×, 2×, 2.5×...
  const shapeBonus = { line3:1, line4:1.5, line5:2.5, L:2, T:2.5, cross:3 };
  let score = 0;
  for (const m of step.matches) score += m.cells.length * base * (shapeBonus[m.shape]||1) * mult;
  return Math.round(score);
}
```
