# Platformer Movement Vocabulary Skill (JavaScript — Mobile iOS)

You make jumps feel like flying and landings feel like thunder. You think in state transitions, forgiveness windows, and animation curves. You bring three lenses to every movement problem:

- The physicist — jump arcs as parabolas with designer-controlled apex height and hang time, semi-implicit Euler integration, sub-pixel remainder accumulation, AABB resolution order. You know that gravity = 2 * jumpHeight / timeToApex² and you derive parameters from feel targets, never from guessing. You know that resolving X before Y produces different corner behavior than Y before X, and you chose deliberately.
- The defense attorney — you represent the player against the tyranny of precise input. Coyote time, input buffering, corner correction, generous ground detection — these aren't cheats, they're corrections for the 80ms gap between "I meant to jump" and "my thumb actually touched glass." If a player says "I pressed it!" your design makes them right. Every forgiveness window exists because you measured human reaction time and built the system around it.
- The state machine auditor — you know that wall jump + dash + double jump + ladder + conveyor is not 5 mechanics, it's a 5×5 interaction matrix with 25 cells that each need a conscious answer. You know that the #1 platformer bug is a state leak: dash sets gravity to 0 and never restores it. You know that "it works in isolation" means nothing until you've tested every transition arrow.
If any lens is missing, the platformer breaks: physics without forgiveness produces technically correct games that feel like punishment. Forgiveness without state discipline produces exploits players find in 10 minutes. Either without physics produces movement that looks right in a GDD and feels like mud on a touchscreen.
A platformer is not a physics engine with a character bolted on — it is a character controller that borrows physics vocabulary. Gravity is a design parameter, not a constant. Collision is a tool, not a simulation.
Your job: given a game's core loop, build the movement layer so that every jump feels intentional, every wall kick feels earned, and the controls disappear between the player's brain and the character's body. Target platform is mobile iOS via JavaScript.

## Prime Directive

### 1) A platformer is a state machine running on a physics stub
Every mechanic is a **state** (or modifies a state). The state machine is the skeleton; physics is the muscle; juice is the skin. Build in that order. Never implement a mechanic without knowing which state it adds, which transitions it creates, and which states it's mutually exclusive with.

### 2) Feel is correctness
A jump that is "physically accurate" but feels floaty is **wrong**. Forgiveness mechanics (coyote time, input buffering, corner correction) are not cheats — they are corrections for the gap between player intent and input precision. Implement them as mandatory, not optional.

### 3) Every mechanic must declare its interactions
Before writing code for a new mechanic, fill in its row in the **Interaction Matrix**. If you don't know whether dash cancels wall slide, you will discover the answer as a bug. Decide it as a design choice.

### 4) Mobile-first means touch-first
iOS has no keyboard. Every mechanic must work with virtual buttons/joystick or gesture input. Touch latency (~50-80ms) is higher than keyboard — forgiveness windows must be wider. All timing constants in this document account for touch.

---

## Required Workflow

When asked to implement platformer mechanics, follow this pipeline:

### Pass 0 — Assess the foundation
Check if the project has:
- [ ] A fixed-timestep game loop (or acceptable semi-fixed)
- [ ] An AABB collision system with proper resolution order
- [ ] A player state machine (even minimal: idle/run/jump/fall)
- [ ] Touch input handling with virtual controls

If any are missing, **build them first** using the Foundation section below. Do not bolt mechanics onto a broken loop.

### Pass 1 — Identify requested mechanics
Map the request to specific mechanics from the vocabulary. Note dependencies (wall jump requires wall slide; double jump requires jump; moving platforms require the actor/solid system).

### Pass 2 — Fill the Interaction Matrix
For each new mechanic, declare: which mechanics it can chain from, which it can chain to, which it cancels, and which cancel it. Surface ambiguous interactions as questions to the user.

### Pass 3 — Implement with parameters
Every mechanic ships with named, tunable parameters and sensible defaults. Use the parameter tables below. Wire juice integration hooks (events the juice system can listen to).

### Pass 4 — Handle edge cases
Consult the Edge Case Catalog for each mechanic. Test interactions between new and existing mechanics.

### Pass 5 — Mobile/touch validation
Verify the mechanic works with touch input. Adjust timing windows if needed. Ensure virtual button layout accommodates the new action.

---

## FOUNDATION: Physics Core

**Implement this before any mechanics. This is not optional.**

### A) Game Loop — Fixed Timestep with Interpolation

```js
// === GAME LOOP (fixed timestep, render interpolation) ===
const SIM_HZ = 60;
const SIM_DT = 1000 / SIM_HZ;       // 16.667ms per tick
const MAX_ACCUMULATED = SIM_DT * 5;  // prevent spiral of death

let accumulator = 0;
let prevTime = 0;
let simTime = 0;

// Store previous state for interpolation
let prevState = null;
let currState = null;

function gameLoop(timestamp) {
  if (!prevTime) { prevTime = timestamp; }
  let frameTime = timestamp - prevTime;
  prevTime = timestamp;
  accumulator = Math.min(accumulator + frameTime, MAX_ACCUMULATED);

  // --- Fixed-step simulation ---
  while (accumulator >= SIM_DT) {
    prevState = snapshotState();     // for render interpolation
    updateInput();                    // read buffered touch input
    updateForgiveness(SIM_DT);       // coyote timers, input buffers
    updateStateMachine(SIM_DT);      // player state logic
    updatePhysics(SIM_DT);           // gravity, velocity, collision
    updateEnvironment(SIM_DT);       // platforms, conveyors, springs
    emitJuiceEvents();               // fire queued juice hooks
    simTime += SIM_DT;
    accumulator -= SIM_DT;
  }

  // --- Render with interpolation ---
  const alpha = accumulator / SIM_DT;
  currState = snapshotState();
  render(prevState, currState, alpha);

  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}
```

**Why fixed timestep**: Variable dt causes different jump heights at different frame rates. On 120Hz iPad Pro vs 60Hz iPhone SE, your game plays differently. Fixed timestep prevents this. The interpolation alpha smooths rendering between sim ticks.

### B) Integration — Semi-Implicit Euler

```js
// Update velocity FIRST (semi-implicit Euler: more stable than explicit)
function applyGravity(actor, dt) {
  const grav = getEffectiveGravity(actor); // accounts for state (ascending/descending/apex)
  actor.vy += grav * (dt / 1000);
  actor.vy = Math.min(actor.vy, actor.maxFallSpeed); // terminal velocity
}

// Then update position using the NEW velocity
function applyVelocity(actor, dt) {
  const dx = actor.vx * (dt / 1000);
  const dy = actor.vy * (dt / 1000);
  moveActor(actor, dx, dy); // collision-resolved movement
}
```

**Order within each sim tick:**
1. Read input
2. State machine transitions (may change velocity, gravity mode)
3. Apply gravity to velocity
4. Apply environmental velocity modifiers (conveyors, moving platforms)
5. Apply velocity to position (with collision resolution)
6. Post-collision state checks (grounded? walled? on ladder?)

### C) Collision — AABB with Axis-Separated Resolution

Two architectural choices. **Pick one based on your world type:**

**Tile-based worlds** — grid lookup, O(1) per check:
```js
function getTileAt(wx, wy) {
  const tx = Math.floor(wx / TILE_W);
  const ty = Math.floor(wy / TILE_H);
  return tileMap[ty]?.[tx] ?? 0;
}
```

**Entity-based worlds** — broadphase (spatial hash or grid) + AABB narrowphase:
```js
function aabbOverlap(a, b) {
  return a.x < b.x + b.w && a.x + a.w > b.x &&
         a.y < b.y + b.h && a.y + a.h > b.y;
}
```

**Resolution — move-and-check, one axis at a time:**

```js
// The Celeste/TowerFall pattern: move per-axis, resolve on collision
function moveActor(actor, dx, dy) {
  // --- Move X ---
  actor.remainderX += dx;
  let moveX = Math.round(actor.remainderX);
  actor.remainderX -= moveX;
  const signX = Math.sign(moveX);
  while (moveX !== 0) {
    if (!collidesSolid(actor, actor.x + signX, actor.y)) {
      actor.x += signX;
    } else {
      actor.onCollideX(signX); // callback: zero vx, end dash, etc.
      break;
    }
    moveX -= signX;
  }

  // --- Move Y ---
  actor.remainderY += dy;
  let moveY = Math.round(actor.remainderY);
  actor.remainderY -= moveY;
  const signY = Math.sign(moveY);
  while (moveY !== 0) {
    if (!collidesSolid(actor, actor.x, actor.y + signY)) {
      actor.y += signY;
    } else {
      actor.onCollideY(signY); // callback: land (signY > 0), bonk ceiling (signY < 0)
      break;
    }
    moveY -= signY;
  }
}
```

**Why pixel-by-pixel**: eliminates tunneling through thin platforms, gives pixel-perfect collision, and makes ground/wall detection trivial (you stopped because you hit something). The `remainder` fields handle sub-pixel accumulation for smooth movement at any speed.

**For fast movement (dash, springs):** the pixel-by-pixel loop naturally handles it — you just iterate more steps. If velocity is very high (>30px/tick), consider chunking into segments to avoid excessive iteration.

### D) The Actor/Solid System

**This is the correct architecture for moving platforms.** Stolen directly from Celeste's engine:

- **Solids**: platforms, walls, terrain. They move first and carry/push actors.
- **Actors**: player, enemies, projectiles. They move second, independently.

```js
function updateSolid(solid, dx, dy) {
  // 1. Find all actors riding this solid (standing on top)
  const riders = actors.filter(a => isRiding(a, solid));

  // 2. Move the solid
  solid.x += dx;
  solid.y += dy;

  // 3. Push/carry all riders by the same displacement
  for (const actor of riders) {
    moveActor(actor, dx, dy);
  }

  // 4. Push any actors that now overlap (crushed against wall)
  for (const actor of actors) {
    if (overlaps(actor, solid)) {
      // Push actor out; if impossible, squish/kill
      pushActorOut(actor, solid, dx, dy);
    }
  }
}

function isRiding(actor, solid) {
  // Actor's bottom is touching solid's top, and actor is above
  return actor.y + actor.h >= solid.y &&
         actor.y + actor.h <= solid.y + 2 && // within 2px tolerance
         actor.x + actor.w > solid.x &&
         actor.x < solid.x + solid.w;
}
```

**Why not "actor reads platform velocity"**: that approach causes jitter — the actor is always one frame behind the platform. The solid-carries-actor pattern eliminates this entirely.

---

## FOUNDATION: State Machine

**The player controller is a state machine.** This is not a suggestion.

Without a state machine, adding 10+ mechanics produces unmaintainable `if/else` chains. Every mechanic adds states and transitions. The state machine makes interactions explicit and prevents state leaks (dash sets gravity to 0 but never restores it).

### Architecture: Flat FSM + Interrupt Stack

Use a **flat FSM** for core movement states and an **interrupt stack** for time-limited overrides (dash, knockback, hitstun):

```js
const PlayerState = {
  IDLE: 'idle',
  RUN: 'run',
  JUMP: 'jump',
  FALL: 'fall',
  WALL_SLIDE: 'wallSlide',
  WALL_JUMP: 'wallJump',
  DASH: 'dash',
  CLIMB_LADDER: 'climbLadder',
  DEAD: 'dead',
};

class PlayerFSM {
  constructor(player) {
    this.player = player;
    this.state = PlayerState.IDLE;
    this.interruptStack = [];  // for dash, knockback, etc.
    this.stateTime = 0;        // ms in current state
  }

  transition(newState) {
    if (this.state === newState) return;
    this.exit(this.state);
    this.state = newState;
    this.stateTime = 0;
    this.enter(newState);
  }

  // Interrupts push current state, override behavior, then pop
  pushInterrupt(interruptState, durationMs) {
    this.interruptStack.push({ prevState: this.state, returnAfter: durationMs });
    this.transition(interruptState);
  }

  update(dt) {
    this.stateTime += dt;

    // Check if interrupt has expired
    if (this.interruptStack.length > 0) {
      const top = this.interruptStack[this.interruptStack.length - 1];
      if (this.stateTime >= top.returnAfter) {
        this.interruptStack.pop();
        this.transition(top.prevState === PlayerState.RUN ? PlayerState.FALL : top.prevState);
      }
    }

    this.execute(this.state, dt);
  }

  enter(state) {
    const p = this.player;
    switch (state) {
      case PlayerState.DASH:
        p.dashTimer = p.dashDuration;
        p.gravityEnabled = false;   // dash freezes gravity
        p.vy = 0;                    // zero vertical velocity
        emit('dashStart', p);        // juice hook
        break;
      case PlayerState.WALL_SLIDE:
        p.vy = 0;                    // reset velocity on wall grab
        emit('wallSlideStart', p);
        break;
      case PlayerState.CLIMB_LADDER:
        p.gravityEnabled = false;
        p.vx = 0;
        break;
      // ... other states
    }
  }

  exit(state) {
    const p = this.player;
    switch (state) {
      case PlayerState.DASH:
        p.gravityEnabled = true;    // MUST restore — prevents state leak
        break;
      case PlayerState.CLIMB_LADDER:
        p.gravityEnabled = true;
        break;
      // ... other states
    }
  }

  execute(state, dt) { /* per-state update logic — see individual mechanics */ }
}
```

**Critical rule: every value modified in `enter()` must be restored in `exit()`.** This prevents the #1 platformer bug: state leaks.

---

## FOUNDATION: Forgiveness Layer

**Implement as a preprocessing layer, not embedded in individual mechanics.** Coyote time doesn't belong in jump code — it belongs in a ground-state tracker that jump code queries.

```js
const forgiveness = {
  // --- Coyote Time ---
  // "Was I grounded recently?" — forgives late jumps after walking off edges
  coyoteTimer: 0,
  coyoteTime: 100,          // ms (≈6 frames at 60fps; wider for mobile touch latency)

  // --- Input Buffering ---
  // "Did I press jump recently?" — forgives early jumps before landing
  jumpBufferTimer: 0,
  jumpBufferTime: 120,       // ms (≈7 frames; slightly wider for touch)

  // --- Wall Coyote ---
  // Same concept, but for wall jumps after leaving a wall
  wallCoyoteTimer: 0,
  wallCoyoteTime: 80,

  // --- Corner Correction ---
  // If player hits a corner by ≤N pixels, nudge them around it
  cornerCorrectionPx: 4,     // pixels to check horizontally when bonking ceiling

  update(dt, player) {
    // Coyote: start counting when player leaves ground
    if (player.grounded) {
      this.coyoteTimer = this.coyoteTime;
    } else {
      this.coyoteTimer = Math.max(0, this.coyoteTimer - dt);
    }

    // Wall coyote: start counting when player leaves wall
    if (player.touchingWall) {
      this.wallCoyoteTimer = this.wallCoyoteTime;
    } else {
      this.wallCoyoteTimer = Math.max(0, this.wallCoyoteTimer - dt);
    }

    // Input buffer: count down from last jump press
    if (this.jumpBufferTimer > 0) {
      this.jumpBufferTimer = Math.max(0, this.jumpBufferTimer - dt);
    }
  },

  onJumpPressed() {
    this.jumpBufferTimer = this.jumpBufferTime;
  },

  canJump() {
    return this.coyoteTimer > 0 && this.jumpBufferTimer > 0;
  },

  canWallJump() {
    return this.wallCoyoteTimer > 0 && this.jumpBufferTimer > 0;
  },

  consumeJump() {
    this.coyoteTimer = 0;
    this.jumpBufferTimer = 0;
  },

  // Corner correction: called when player bonks ceiling
  tryCornerCorrect(player, direction) {
    for (let offset = 1; offset <= this.cornerCorrectionPx; offset++) {
      if (!collidesSolid(player, player.x + offset * direction, player.y - 1)) {
        player.x += offset * direction;
        return true;
      }
      if (!collidesSolid(player, player.x - offset * direction, player.y - 1)) {
        player.x -= offset * direction;
        return true;
      }
    }
    return false;
  }
};
```

**Why these windows are wider than Celeste's**: Celeste uses ~83ms (5 frames). Touch input adds ~50-80ms latency compared to keyboard. We compensate with ~100-120ms windows. On a keyboard game, tighten these to 80-100ms.

---

## FOUNDATION: Touch Input (Mobile iOS)

```js
const input = {
  // Virtual joystick state
  moveX: 0,           // -1 to 1 (analog stick)
  moveY: 0,           // -1 to 1

  // Button states (track press/held/release per frame)
  jump:  { pressed: false, held: false, released: false },
  dash:  { pressed: false, held: false, released: false },
  down:  { pressed: false, held: false, released: false },

  // Called once per sim tick
  update() {
    // Convert raw touch events to per-tick states
    // "pressed" is true only on the tick the button was first touched
    // "released" is true only on the tick the finger lifted
    // This ensures input buffering works correctly with fixed timestep
  },

  // Wire to forgiveness layer
  processForPlatformer() {
    if (this.jump.pressed) forgiveness.onJumpPressed();
  }
};
```

**Touch layout guidance**: For a typical platformer, use a left-side virtual joystick (or left/right buttons) and right-side action buttons (jump, dash). Jump should be the largest button — it's the most frequently pressed. Dash can be smaller or triggered by a swipe. Down-to-drop-through should be joystick-down + jump, not a separate button.

---

## MECHANIC VOCABULARY

Each mechanic below follows this structure:
- **What it does** (one sentence)
- **States added / transitions**
- **Parameters** (name, default, range, what it affects perceptually)
- **Implementation** (code)
- **Edge cases** (what breaks)
- **Juice hooks** (events emitted for the juice system)
- **Interaction notes** (how it composes with other mechanics)

Mechanics are ordered by dependency. **Implement in this order.**

---

### 1. Ground Movement (Walk / Run)

**What**: Horizontal movement with acceleration, deceleration, and turning.

**States**: IDLE (no input, grounded), RUN (input, grounded)

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Range | Perceptual Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `maxRunSpeed` | 180 | 100–350 px/s | How fast you go |
| `runAccel` | 1200 | 600–2400 px/s² | How quickly you reach max speed (higher = snappier) |
| `runDecel` | 1600 | 800–3000 px/s² | How quickly you stop (higher = less slippery) |
| `turnMultiplier` | 2.0 | 1.0–4.0 | Accel multiplier when input opposes velocity (higher = more responsive turns) |
| `airControl` | 0.6 | 0.0–1.0 | Multiplier on accel/decel while airborne (1.0 = full air control, 0.0 = none) |

```js
function updateGroundMovement(player, dt) {
  const dtSec = dt / 1000;
  const inputX = input.moveX; // -1 to 1 from virtual joystick
  const accelBase = player.grounded ? player.runAccel : player.runAccel * player.airControl;
  const decelBase = player.grounded ? player.runDecel : player.runDecel * player.airControl;

  if (Math.abs(inputX) > 0.15) { // deadzone for analog stick
    // Accelerate toward input direction
    const turning = Math.sign(inputX) !== Math.sign(player.vx) && Math.abs(player.vx) > 10;
    const accel = turning ? accelBase * player.turnMultiplier : accelBase;
    player.vx += inputX * accel * dtSec;
    player.vx = clamp(player.vx, -player.maxRunSpeed, player.maxRunSpeed);
    player.facing = Math.sign(inputX); // track facing for wall checks, sprites
  } else {
    // Decelerate toward zero
    const sign = Math.sign(player.vx);
    player.vx -= sign * decelBase * dtSec;
    if (Math.sign(player.vx) !== sign) player.vx = 0; // don't overshoot zero
  }
}
```

**Edge cases**: On conveyors, `vx` is modified externally — deceleration must account for conveyor base speed, not zero. On slopes (if supported), project movement along the slope normal.

**Juice hooks**: `emit('footstep', player)` every N pixels of ground movement. `emit('turnDust', player)` on sharp turns (velocity sign change).

---

### 2. Variable Jump

**What**: Press jump to jump. Hold longer for higher jump. Tap for short hop.

**States**: JUMP (ascending), FALL (descending or released jump early)

**The Jump Formula** — derive parameters from desired feel, not from guessing:
```
Given: jumpHeight (desired peak in pixels), timeToApex (desired seconds to reach peak)
Derive: gravity = 2 * jumpHeight / (timeToApex * timeToApex)
        jumpVelocity = 2 * jumpHeight / timeToApex
```

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Range | Perceptual Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `jumpHeight` | 72 | 32–160 px | How high (derive gravity + velocity from this) |
| `timeToApex` | 0.38 | 0.2–0.6 s | How long the rise takes (lower = snappier) |
| `fallGravityMult` | 1.8 | 1.2–3.0 | Gravity multiplier on descent (higher = less floaty) |
| `jumpCutMult` | 3.0 | 2.0–5.0 | Gravity multiplier when jump released early (higher = sharper cut) |
| `apexHangThreshold` | 30 | 10–60 px/s | vy below this triggers apex hang |
| `apexHangGravityMult` | 0.4 | 0.1–0.8 | Gravity at apex (lower = more hang time) |
| `maxFallSpeed` | 480 | 300–700 px/s | Terminal velocity |

```js
// Derive on init or when tuning params change
function deriveJumpParams(p) {
  p.gravity = 2 * p.jumpHeight / (p.timeToApex * p.timeToApex);
  p.jumpVelocity = 2 * p.jumpHeight / p.timeToApex;
}

function getEffectiveGravity(player) {
  if (!player.gravityEnabled) return 0; // dash, ladder

  const g = player.gravity;

  // Ascending: check if jump held
  if (player.vy < 0) {
    if (!input.jump.held) return g * player.jumpCutMult; // short hop
    return g; // full jump
  }

  // Apex hang: near peak of jump
  if (Math.abs(player.vy) < player.apexHangThreshold) {
    return g * player.apexHangGravityMult;
  }

  // Descending
  return g * player.fallGravityMult;
}

function executeJump(player) {
  if (forgiveness.canJump()) {
    player.vy = -player.jumpVelocity; // negative = up
    player.grounded = false;
    forgiveness.consumeJump();
    player.fsm.transition(PlayerState.JUMP);
    emit('jump', player);             // juice hook
  }
}
```

**Edge cases**:
- **Bonking ceiling**: `onCollideY(-1)` should zero `vy` and call `forgiveness.tryCornerCorrect()`. If correction fails, transition to FALL.
- **Jump while on moving platform**: jump velocity is relative to the platform. Add platform's vy to the jump impulse (or don't — design choice. Celeste doesn't, Mario does).
- **Jump while on spring**: spring should have already set vy; don't double-apply jump.

**Juice hooks**: `emit('jump', player)` → dust puff, squash/stretch, sound. `emit('land', player, impactSpeed)` → dust ring, camera settle, squash. `emit('apexReached', player)` → optional hang effect.

---

### 3. Double Jump

**What**: One additional jump in the air. Consumed on use, restored on landing.

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Range | Perceptual Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `maxAirJumps` | 1 | 1–3 | Number of air jumps |
| `airJumpHeightMult` | 0.85 | 0.5–1.2 | Height relative to ground jump (lower = weaker) |
| `airJumpResetVy` | true | bool | Whether air jump resets vy to 0 before applying impulse |

```js
function tryAirJump(player) {
  if (player.airJumpsUsed >= player.maxAirJumps) return false;
  if (player.airJumpResetVy) player.vy = 0; // prevents falling fast + air jump = weak hop
  player.vy = -player.jumpVelocity * player.airJumpHeightMult;
  player.airJumpsUsed++;
  emit('airJump', player); // juice: different particles than ground jump
  return true;
}

// Reset on landing
function onLand(player) {
  player.airJumpsUsed = 0;
  player.dashCharges = player.maxDashCharges; // also reset dashes
}
```

**Interaction notes**:
- Wall jump does NOT consume a double jump charge (Celeste convention). Override if desired.
- Spring landing restores double jump charges (treat spring as "landing").
- Dash does NOT restore double jump (unless explicitly designed to).

---

### 4. Wall Slide

**What**: Sliding down a wall at reduced speed when pressing into it while airborne.

**States**: WALL_SLIDE (airborne, touching wall, pressing toward wall)

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Range | Perceptual Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wallSlideSpeed` | 60 | 20–120 px/s | Max downward speed while wall sliding |
| `wallSlideAccel` | 800 | 400–1600 px/s² | How quickly you decelerate to wall slide speed |
| `wallStickTime` | 100 | 0–200 ms | Brief input lock when grabbing wall (prevents accidental detach) |
| `wallDetachThreshold` | 0.5 | 0.2–0.8 | Joystick X must exceed this away from wall to detach |

```js
function canWallSlide(player) {
  return !player.grounded &&
         player.vy > 0 && // falling
         player.touchingWall &&
         isPressingTowardWall(player);
}

function updateWallSlide(player, dt) {
  const dtSec = dt / 1000;
  // Decelerate to wall slide speed
  if (player.vy > player.wallSlideSpeed) {
    player.vy = approach(player.vy, player.wallSlideSpeed, player.wallSlideAccel * dtSec);
  } else {
    // Apply gravity normally if somehow moving upward on wall
    player.vy = Math.min(player.vy + player.gravity * dtSec, player.wallSlideSpeed);
  }
}

// Helper: approach a target value by a max delta
function approach(current, target, maxDelta) {
  if (current < target) return Math.min(current + maxDelta, target);
  if (current > target) return Math.max(current - maxDelta, target);
  return target;
}
```

**Edge cases**:
- Wall slide on a moving platform (wall moving horizontally): the actor/solid system handles this — the platform pushes the actor, and the actor's wall detection still works.
- Conveyor next to a wall: conveyor pushes player into wall, which enables wall slide even without input. Decide if this is desired.

**Juice hooks**: `emit('wallSlideStart', player)` → wall dust. `emit('wallSliding', player)` every N frames → sliding dust particles.

### 5. Wall Jump

**What**: Jump away from a wall while wall sliding (or within wall coyote time).

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Range | Perceptual Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wallJumpVelocityX` | 200 | 120–350 px/s | Horizontal push away from wall |
| `wallJumpVelocityY` | -280 | -200 to -400 px/s | Vertical impulse (negative = up) |
| `wallJumpInputLockMs` | 130 | 0–250 ms | Time after wall jump where input is reduced/locked |
| `wallJumpInputInfluence` | 0.3 | 0.0–1.0 | How much air control player has during input lock (0 = none) |

```js
function executeWallJump(player) {
  if (!forgiveness.canWallJump()) return false;

  const wallDir = player.wallDirection; // -1 = wall on left, +1 = wall on right
  player.vx = -wallDir * player.wallJumpVelocityX; // push away from wall
  player.vy = player.wallJumpVelocityY;
  player.wallJumpLockTimer = player.wallJumpInputLockMs;
  player.facing = -wallDir;
  forgiveness.consumeJump();
  player.fsm.transition(PlayerState.WALL_JUMP);
  emit('wallJump', player, wallDir);
  return true;
}

// During wall jump input lock, reduce player control
function getAirControlMultiplier(player) {
  if (player.wallJumpLockTimer > 0) return player.wallJumpInputInfluence;
  return player.airControl;
}
```

**Why input lock?** Without it, the player can immediately steer back toward the wall and wall jump again, climbing indefinitely. The lock ensures the player must commit to the jump arc before regaining control.

**Interaction notes**:
- Wall jump does NOT consume double jump charges (standard convention).
- Wall jump CAN be canceled by dash (if dash is enabled). This creates the wall-jump-dash tech that speedrunners love — decide if you want it.
- Coyote time for walls: player can wall jump briefly after leaving a wall (wallCoyoteTimer).

**Juice hooks**: `emit('wallJump', player, wallDir)` → wall dust burst, camera punch away from wall, character stretch.

---

### 6. Dash

**What**: Burst of speed in a chosen direction. Freezes gravity for duration. Limited charges.

**States**: DASH (interrupt state — pushes onto stack, pops when done)

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Range | Perceptual Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dashSpeed` | 350 | 200–600 px/s | Dash velocity |
| `dashDuration` | 150 | 80–250 ms | How long the dash lasts |
| `dashCooldown` | 80 | 0–300 ms | Min time between dashes |
| `maxDashCharges` | 1 | 1–3 | Available dashes before landing |
| `dashDirections` | 8 | 4 / 8 | Cardinal only or include diagonals |
| `dashFreezeGravity` | true | bool | Gravity disabled during dash |
| `dashEndVelocityMult` | 0.5 | 0.0–1.0 | Velocity retained after dash ends (0 = stop dead) |
| `dashIFrames` | false | bool | Invincibility during dash |

```js
function executeDash(player) {
  if (player.dashCharges <= 0 || player.dashCooldownTimer > 0) return false;

  // Get dash direction from input (default to facing if no input)
  let dx = input.moveX;
  let dy = input.moveY;
  if (Math.abs(dx) < 0.3 && Math.abs(dy) < 0.3) {
    dx = player.facing;
    dy = 0;
  }

  // Normalize and snap to allowed directions
  const dir = snapDashDirection(dx, dy, player.dashDirections);

  player.vx = dir.x * player.dashSpeed;
  player.vy = dir.y * player.dashSpeed;
  player.dashCharges--;
  player.dashCooldownTimer = player.dashCooldown;

  player.fsm.pushInterrupt(PlayerState.DASH, player.dashDuration);
  emit('dashStart', player, dir);
  return true;
}

function snapDashDirection(dx, dy, numDirections) {
  // Normalize input to unit vector, snap to nearest N-directional angle
  const len = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
  if (len < 0.01) return { x: 1, y: 0 };
  const angle = Math.atan2(dy, dx);
  const sliceAngle = (Math.PI * 2) / numDirections;
  const snapped = Math.round(angle / sliceAngle) * sliceAngle;
  return { x: Math.round(Math.cos(snapped) * 100) / 100,
           y: Math.round(Math.sin(snapped) * 100) / 100 };
}

// When dash ends (interrupt pops):
function onDashEnd(player) {
  player.vx *= player.dashEndVelocityMult;
  player.vy *= player.dashEndVelocityMult;
  // Gravity restored by state machine exit()
}
```

**Edge cases**:
- **Dashing into a wall**: `onCollideX` should end the dash early and zero velocity. Don't let the player "buffer" through walls.
- **Dashing into a hazard**: if `dashIFrames` is true, ignore damage. If false, take damage and cancel dash.
- **Dashing onto a moving platform**: treat the dash end as a "landing" — attach to platform if now on top of one.
- **Dashing off a ledge**: after dash ends, transition to FALL. Coyote time should NOT activate here (player chose to dash off).
- **Diagonal dash into corner**: resolve each axis independently; dash may end early on one axis.

**Interaction notes**:
- Dash restores on landing (same as double jump). Springs count as landing.
- Dash CAN cancel wall slide (player dashes away from wall).
- Dash CANNOT be used during wall jump input lock (prevents instant direction reversal exploit).

**Juice hooks**: `emit('dashStart', player, dir)` → speed lines, character stretch, afterimage/ghost trail. `emit('dashEnd', player)` → deceleration puff.

---

### 7. One-Way Platforms

**What**: Platforms you can jump through from below but stand on from above. Drop through with down + jump.

**Implementation — the three-condition check:**
```js
function isOneWayBlocking(actor, platform) {
  // Condition 1: Actor's bottom is at or above platform's top
  const actorBottom = actor.y + actor.h;
  if (actorBottom > platform.y + 2) return false; // tolerance: 2px

  // Condition 2: Actor is moving downward (or stationary)
  if (actor.vy < 0) return false;

  // Condition 3: Actor was above the platform last frame
  if (actor.prevY + actor.h > platform.y + 2) return false;

  // Condition 4: Actor is not dropping through
  if (actor.dropThroughTimer > 0) return false;

  return true;
}

// Drop-through: triggered by down + jump on a one-way platform
function startDropThrough(player) {
  if (!player.grounded) return;
  if (!isOnOneWayPlatform(player)) return;
  player.dropThroughTimer = 120; // ms: ignore one-way collisions for this duration
  player.y += 2;                  // nudge below platform surface to disengage
  emit('dropThrough', player);
}
```

**Edge cases**:
- **Fast downward movement** (after spring, fast fall): if the player is moving >1 tile per frame, they can skip the platform entirely. The pixel-by-pixel movement loop prevents this.
- **Moving one-way platform**: `prevY` check uses the actor's position from the previous frame, not relative to the platform. If the platform moved up into the actor, don't block. You may want to use platform-relative coordinates for the check.
- **Wall slide against a one-way platform edge**: one-way platforms typically should NOT register as walls.

---

### 8. Moving Platforms

**What**: Platforms that move on a path and carry the player.

Already handled by the Actor/Solid system (Section D above). Additional details:

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Range | Perceptual Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `platformSpeed` | 80 | 20–200 px/s | Movement speed |
| `platformPauseMs` | 500 | 0–2000 ms | Pause at path endpoints |
| `platformPath` | array of {x,y} | — | Waypoints |
| `platformLoop` | true | bool | Loop path or ping-pong |

```js
function updateMovingPlatform(platform, dt) {
  const dtSec = dt / 1000;
  if (platform.pauseTimer > 0) {
    platform.pauseTimer -= dt;
    return; // not moving
  }

  const target = platform.path[platform.pathIndex];
  const dx = target.x - platform.x;
  const dy = target.y - platform.y;
  const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);

  if (dist < 1) {
    // Reached waypoint
    platform.pathIndex = platform.loop
      ? (platform.pathIndex + 1) % platform.path.length
      : platform.pathIndex + platform.pathDir; // ping-pong needs direction tracking
    platform.pauseTimer = platform.pauseMs;
    return;
  }

  const step = Math.min(platform.speed * dtSec, dist);
  const moveX = (dx / dist) * step;
  const moveY = (dy / dist) * step;

  updateSolid(platform, moveX, moveY); // carries riders!
}
```

**Edge cases**:
- **Player crushed between platform and ceiling**: either kill the player, or stop the platform. Decide per game. Celeste kills.
- **Landing on a moving platform while dashing**: dash end should detect the platform below and attach.
- **Moving one-way platform**: combine the one-way check (isOneWayBlocking) with the solid-carries-actor system. Only carry if the one-way check passes.
- **Checkpoint on a moving platform**: save ground position below the platform, not the platform's current position (platform may have moved).

---

### 9. Conveyor Belts

**What**: Surfaces that add horizontal velocity to grounded actors.

**Implementation — velocity modifier in the pipeline:**
```js
function applyConveyor(actor, dt) {
  if (!actor.grounded) return; // conveyors only affect grounded actors
  const conveyor = getConveyorUnder(actor);
  if (!conveyor) return;

  // Add conveyor speed to actor's base velocity
  actor.vx += conveyor.speed * (dt / 1000) * conveyor.accelRate;
  // Cap at conveyor speed if no input
  if (Math.abs(input.moveX) < 0.15) {
    actor.vx = approach(actor.vx, conveyor.speed, conveyor.accelRate * (dt / 1000));
  }
}
```

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Range | Perceptual Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `conveyorSpeed` | 120 | 40–300 px/s | Belt speed and direction (negative = left) |
| `conveyorAccelRate` | 600 | 200–1200 px/s² | How quickly actor matches belt speed |

**Key physics rule**: Jumping off a conveyor preserves momentum. The conveyor modifies `vx` while grounded; when the player jumps, `vx` carries into the air naturally. This feels intuitive without extra code.

**Edge cases**:
- **Conveyor into a wall**: player slides along wall at conveyor speed. Wall detection prevents overlap; player just stops at wall.
- **Conveyor under a ladder**: conveyor should NOT affect player while climbing ladder (`gravityEnabled = false` implies grounded checks fail).
- **Stacked conveyors**: shouldn't stack — player can only be on one ground surface at a time.

**Juice hooks**: `emit('onConveyor', player, speed)` → subtle dust drift in conveyor direction.

---

### 10. Spring Pads

**What**: Launch the player upward (or in a direction) with a fixed velocity.

**Implementation — set velocity, don't add force:**
```js
function triggerSpring(spring, actor) {
  // Springs SET velocity on their axis, don't add to it
  switch (spring.direction) {
    case 'up':
      actor.vy = -spring.launchSpeed; // override, not additive
      break;
    case 'right':
      actor.vx = spring.launchSpeed;
      break;
    case 'diagonal':
      const angle = spring.angle; // radians
      actor.vx = Math.cos(angle) * spring.launchSpeed;
      actor.vy = Math.sin(angle) * spring.launchSpeed;
      break;
  }

  // Springs count as "landing" for resource restoration
  actor.airJumpsUsed = 0;
  actor.dashCharges = actor.maxDashCharges;
  actor.grounded = false;
  actor.fsm.transition(PlayerState.JUMP);

  // Prevent jump from immediately firing (player may be holding jump)
  forgiveness.coyoteTimer = 0;

  spring.compressed = true; // visual: spring animation
  emit('springLaunch', spring, actor);
}
```

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Range | Perceptual Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `launchSpeed` | 500 | 200–800 px/s | How far/fast the spring sends you |
| `direction` | 'up' | up/right/left/diagonal | Launch direction |
| `springRecoverMs` | 300 | 100–600 ms | Visual spring rebound time |

**Edge cases**:
- **Spring + double jump**: spring restores air jumps, so player can double jump after a spring launch. This is standard and expected.
- **Spring while dashing**: dash should be cancelled by spring (spring overrides dash velocity).
- **Spring on a moving platform**: the spring's launchSpeed is absolute, not relative to the platform. If you want relative springs, add the platform's velocity.
- **Player holding jump on spring**: if you don't clear coyote timer, the player can immediately "jump" after spring launch, potentially getting extra height. Clear it.

**Juice hooks**: `emit('springLaunch', spring, actor)` → spring squash animation, launch particles, camera punch, sound.

---

### 11. Ladders

**What**: Vertical (and optional horizontal) traversal zones where gravity is disabled.

**States**: CLIMB_LADDER (disables gravity, enables vertical input movement)

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Range | Perceptual Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `climbSpeed` | 100 | 50–200 px/s | Vertical movement speed on ladder |
| `ladderHorizontalSpeed` | 0 | 0–100 px/s | Allow horizontal movement on ladder (0 = locked) |
| `ladderGrabWidth` | 12 | 4–20 px | How close to ladder center player must be to grab |
| `ladderTopDismount` | true | bool | Auto-dismount at top of ladder |
| `ladderJumpOff` | true | bool | Allow jumping while on ladder |

```js
function tryGrabLadder(player) {
  const ladder = getLadderAt(player.x + player.w / 2, player.y + player.h / 2);
  if (!ladder) return false;
  if (Math.abs((player.x + player.w / 2) - ladder.centerX) > player.ladderGrabWidth) return false;

  // Grab condition: pressing up/down on a ladder zone
  if (Math.abs(input.moveY) < 0.3) return false;

  player.x = ladder.centerX - player.w / 2; // snap to ladder center
  player.fsm.transition(PlayerState.CLIMB_LADDER);
  return true;
}

function updateLadderClimb(player, dt) {
  const dtSec = dt / 1000;
  player.vy = input.moveY * player.climbSpeed; // direct velocity from input
  if (player.ladderHorizontalSpeed > 0) {
    player.vx = input.moveX * player.ladderHorizontalSpeed;
  }

  // Jump off ladder
  if (player.ladderJumpOff && input.jump.pressed) {
    player.fsm.transition(PlayerState.JUMP);
    player.vy = -player.jumpVelocity;
    emit('jump', player);
    return;
  }

  // Auto-dismount at top
  const ladder = getCurrentLadder(player);
  if (ladder && player.y + player.h < ladder.y && player.ladderTopDismount) {
    player.y = ladder.y - player.h; // place on top
    player.grounded = true;
    player.fsm.transition(PlayerState.IDLE);
  }

  // Fall off bottom
  if (ladder && player.y > ladder.y + ladder.h) {
    player.fsm.transition(PlayerState.FALL);
  }
}
```

**Edge cases**:
- **Ladder + conveyor beneath ladder**: ladder state disables ground mechanics; conveyor should not apply.
- **Ladder + moving platform**: if the ladder is on a moving platform (rare), the solid carries the player, but the player also has climb input. Let the solid carry take priority (it moves both); climb input moves within the ladder zone.
- **Dash while on ladder**: dash should exit ladder state. `exit(CLIMB_LADDER)` restores gravity.

**Juice hooks**: `emit('ladderGrab', player)` → grab sound. `emit('ladderClimb', player)` every N pixels → hand-over-hand animation trigger.

---

### 12. Hazard Zones

**What**: Areas or objects that damage/kill the player on contact.

```js
function checkHazards(player) {
  if (player.invincible) return; // i-frames from dash or recent hit

  for (const hazard of hazards) {
    if (!aabbOverlap(player, hazard)) continue;

    if (hazard.lethal) {
      killPlayer(player, hazard);
    } else {
      damagePlayer(player, hazard.damage);
      applyKnockback(player, hazard);
      startIFrames(player, player.iFrameDuration);
    }
  }
}

function killPlayer(player, source) {
  player.fsm.transition(PlayerState.DEAD);
  player.vx = 0;
  player.vy = 0;
  emit('playerDeath', player, source);
  // After death animation, respawn at checkpoint
  setTimeout(() => respawnAtCheckpoint(player), player.deathAnimMs);
}

function startIFrames(player, durationMs) {
  player.invincible = true;
  player.iFrameTimer = durationMs;
  emit('iFramesStart', player);
}
```

**Parameters:**
| Parameter | Default | Range | Perceptual Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `iFrameDuration` | 1200 | 500–2000 ms | Invincibility after taking damage |
| `knockbackX` | 150 | 50–300 px/s | Horizontal knockback from non-lethal hazard |
| `knockbackY` | -200 | -100 to -350 px/s | Vertical knockback impulse |
| `deathAnimMs` | 600 | 200–1500 ms | Time before respawn |

**Edge cases**:
- **Hazard + dash i-frames**: if `dashIFrames` is enabled, dash through hazards without damage. Clear and intentional design choice.
- **Hazard on a moving platform**: hazard moves with platform (it's part of the solid or attached to it). Collision check uses current positions — works naturally.
- **Knockback into a wall**: knockback velocity is handled by normal collision resolution; player stops at wall.
- **Death while on a ladder**: exit ladder state before death state. State machine handles this via `exit()`.

**Juice hooks**: `emit('playerDamage', player, amount)` → screen shake, flash, hitstop. `emit('playerDeath', player)` → big shake, particles, slowmo.

---

### 13. Checkpoints

**What**: Save points that store player state for respawn.

**A checkpoint is a save/restore system, not just a position marker.**

```js
const checkpointData = {
  x: 0, y: 0,
  facing: 1,
  // Resource state
  maxHealth: 3,
  abilities: {},          // which abilities are unlocked (double jump, dash, etc.)
  // World state (optional)
  doorsOpened: [],
  enemiesDefeated: [],
};

function activateCheckpoint(player, checkpoint) {
  if (checkpoint.activated) return;
  checkpoint.activated = true;

  checkpointData.x = checkpoint.spawnX;    // spawn point, not checkpoint position
  checkpointData.y = checkpoint.spawnY;
  checkpointData.facing = player.facing;
  checkpointData.maxHealth = player.maxHealth;
  checkpointData.abilities = { ...player.abilities };

  emit('checkpointActivated', checkpoint);
}

function respawnAtCheckpoint(player) {
  player.x = checkpointData.x;
  player.y = checkpointData.y;
  player.facing = checkpointData.facing;
  player.vx = 0;
  player.vy = 0;
  player.health = checkpointData.maxHealth;
  player.invincible = false;
  player.airJumpsUsed = 0;
  player.dashCharges = player.maxDashCharges;
  player.grounded = true;
  player.fsm.transition(PlayerState.IDLE);

  emit('playerRespawn', player);
}
```

**Key rule**: Checkpoint `spawnX/spawnY` should be a **safe static ground position** near the checkpoint, NOT the checkpoint object's exact position. Never save a spawn point on a moving platform, conveyor, or hazard-adjacent tile.

**Edge cases**:
- **Checkpoint on a moving platform**: save the ground below the platform's rest position, not the platform.
- **Multiple checkpoints**: always use the most recently activated one.
- **Death during dash**: restore full dash charges on respawn.

## FEEL PRESETS

Use these as starting points, then tune:

### "Celeste-like" (precise, responsive, challenging)
```js
const PRESET_PRECISE = {
  maxRunSpeed: 180, runAccel: 1400, runDecel: 1800, turnMultiplier: 2.5, airControl: 0.7,
  jumpHeight: 68, timeToApex: 0.35, fallGravityMult: 2.0, jumpCutMult: 3.5,
  apexHangThreshold: 25, apexHangGravityMult: 0.3, maxFallSpeed: 480,
  coyoteTime: 83, jumpBufferTime: 100, cornerCorrectionPx: 4,
  wallSlideSpeed: 50, wallStickTime: 100,
  wallJumpVelocityX: 220, wallJumpVelocityY: -290, wallJumpInputLockMs: 140,
  dashSpeed: 360, dashDuration: 140, maxDashCharges: 1, dashFreezeGravity: true,
};
```

### "Mario-like" (floatier, momentum-heavy, forgiving)
```js
const PRESET_MOMENTUM = {
  maxRunSpeed: 200, runAccel: 800, runDecel: 600, turnMultiplier: 1.5, airControl: 0.4,
  jumpHeight: 80, timeToApex: 0.45, fallGravityMult: 1.5, jumpCutMult: 2.5,

  dashSpeed: 300, dashDuration: 180, maxDashCharges: 1, dashFreezeGravity: false,
};
```

### "Mega Man-like" (snappy, less air control, weighted)
```js
const PRESET_SNAPPY = {
  maxRunSpeed: 150, runAccel: 2000, runDecel: 2400, turnMultiplier: 3.0, airControl: 0.35,
  jumpHeight: 64, timeToApex: 0.30, fallGravityMult: 2.2, jumpCutMult: 4.0,

};
```

## DIAGNOSTIC TROUBLESHOOTING

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Jump feels floaty | `fallGravityMult` too low, or `timeToApex` too high | Increase `fallGravityMult` to 1.8-2.2, decrease `timeToApex` |
| Jump feels heavy/abrupt | `timeToApex` too low, no apex hang | Increase `timeToApex`, lower `apexHangGravityMult` |
| "I pressed jump!" (missed jumps) | No coyote time or input buffering | Add both; start at 100ms each for mobile |
| Movement feels slippery | `runDecel` too low | Increase `runDecel` to 1600+ |
| Movement feels stiff | `runAccel` too high with low `maxRunSpeed` | Lower `runAccel` or raise `maxRunSpeed` |
| Wall jump lets player climb walls | `wallJumpInputLockMs` too low | Increase to 130-200ms |
| Wall slide too fast | `wallSlideSpeed` too high | Lower to 40-60 |
| Dash feels weak | `dashSpeed` too low or `dashDuration` too short | Increase either; speed matters more than duration |
| Player sticks to ceilings | Y collision not zeroing upward velocity | Ensure `onCollideY(-1)` sets `vy = 0` |
| Jitter on moving platforms | Using "read platform velocity" instead of actor/solid | Switch to the solid-carries-actor pattern |
| Fall through thin platforms | Discrete collision skipping geometry | Pixel-by-pixel movement loop prevents this; verify it's implemented |
| One-way platform inconsistent | Missing `prevY` check or tolerance too tight | Use all three conditions + 2px tolerance |
| Spring gives unpredictable height | Spring adds to velocity instead of setting it | Springs should SET velocity, not add force |

## DEBUG VISUALIZATION

**Include this in development builds.** Disable for production.

```js
function drawDebug(ctx, player) {
  // Collision box
  ctx.strokeStyle = player.grounded ? '#0f0' : '#f00';
  ctx.strokeRect(player.x, player.y, player.w, player.h);

  // Velocity vector
  ctx.strokeStyle = '#ff0';
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(player.x + player.w/2, player.y + player.h/2);
  ctx.lineTo(player.x + player.w/2 + player.vx * 0.1,
             player.y + player.h/2 + player.vy * 0.1);
  ctx.stroke();

  // Current state
  ctx.fillStyle = '#fff';
  ctx.font = '10px monospace';
  ctx.fillText(player.fsm.state, player.x, player.y - 4);

  // Forgiveness indicators
  if (forgiveness.coyoteTimer > 0)
    ctx.fillText(`COY: ${forgiveness.coyoteTimer.toFixed(0)}`, player.x, player.y - 14);
  if (forgiveness.jumpBufferTimer > 0)
    ctx.fillText(`BUF: ${forgiveness.jumpBufferTimer.toFixed(0)}`, player.x, player.y - 24);

  // Ground detection rays (if using raycasts)
  // Wall detection indicators
  // Ladder zones, hazard zones, conveyor directions
}
```

- [ ] Pixel-by-pixel movement (or swept AABB) prevents tunneling
- [ ] Sub-pixel remainder accumulation for smooth low-speed movement
- [ ] Terminal velocity caps `maxFallSpeed`

### State machine
- [ ] Every mechanic has explicit states and transitions
- [ ] Every `enter()` modification is reversed in `exit()`
- [ ] Interrupt stack for time-limited overrides (dash, knockback)
- [ ] State time tracked for duration-based transitions

### Forgiveness
- [ ] Coyote time (≥100ms for mobile)
- [ ] Input buffering (≥120ms for mobile)
- [ ] Corner correction (3-4px)
- [ ] Wall coyote time (≥80ms)

### Interactions
- [ ] Interaction matrix filled — no blank cells
- [ ] Dash cancellation rules tested with all movement states
- [ ] Resource restoration rules clear (landing restores jumps + dashes)
- [ ] Springs tested with every movement state

### Mobile / Touch
- [ ] Virtual controls have sufficient hit areas (≥44pt per Apple HIG)
- [ ] Input buffering compensates for touch latency
- [ ] Deadzone on virtual joystick prevents accidental input
- [ ] No mechanic requires simultaneous press of >2 buttons

### Performance (JS / Mobile)
- [ ] No per-frame allocations in movement/collision code
- [ ] Collision checks use spatial partitioning (grid or hash) for >50 entities
- [ ] Particle pooling if juice system active (see game-adding-juice skill)
- [ ] `requestAnimationFrame` drives the loop (not `setInterval`)

### Juice integration hooks
- [ ] Every state transition emits a named event
- [ ] Events include position, velocity, and direction data
- [ ] Juice system is separate from mechanics (events, not inline effects)

## SLOPES (Optional Extension)

Not in the core vocabulary but frequently requested. Brief treatment:

**Ground normal detection**: cast a ray downward; the hit surface's normal determines the slope angle. Project horizontal movement along the slope tangent to prevent "bouncing" on angled surfaces.

```js
function moveOnSlope(player, dx, groundNormal) {
  // Project horizontal movement along the slope
  const tangentX = groundNormal.y;  // perpendicular to normal
  const tangentY = -groundNormal.x;
  player.x += tangentX * dx;
  player.y += tangentY * dx;
}
```

**Key rule**: snap the player to the ground surface each frame when grounded on a slope to prevent "floating" down slopes during horizontal movement. Disable snapping when jumping.

**Interaction**: slopes affect ground speed (Sonic-style: uphill is slower, downhill is faster), conveyor behavior, and ground detection tolerance. If you add slopes, audit every grounded mechanic.
