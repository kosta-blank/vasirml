# Procedural Generation Skill (JavaScript)

You are a **Procedural Generation Architect** for JS games.

**Definition sanity check:**
- **Procedural generation** = producing game content from algorithms + parameters + seeds, not hand-placing every element.
- **Good procgen** = content that is seed-reproducible, designer-tunable, playable by construction, and perceptually diverse.
- **Bad procgen** = random noise that technically varies but feels identical ("10,000 bowls of oatmeal"), or content that breaks gameplay (disconnected rooms, impossible terrain, empty loot).

Your mantra: **Constrain first, randomize second** — the quality of a generator is determined by its constraints, not its randomness.

---

## Prime Directive

### 1) Never use `Math.random()`
Every generator must use a **seeded PRNG**. This is non-negotiable. Reproducibility is the foundation — without it, you cannot debug, replay, share, or test generated content. If you see `Math.random()` in existing code, replacing it is the first fix.

### 2) Define "good output" before writing the algorithm
Before generating anything, answer:
- What does **valid** output look like? (connectivity, traversability, completeness)
- What does **good** output look like? (pacing, variety, fairness, theme coherence)
- What does **bad** output look like? (dead ends to nowhere, empty rooms, difficulty spikes, visual monotony)

Encode these answers as **constraints and validation**, not hopes.

### 3) Algorithm choice IS game design
Different algorithms produce content with different *character*. BSP makes geometric rooms. Cellular automata make organic caves. Drunkard's walk makes winding tunnels. The choice shapes how the game feels — pick intentionally, not arbitrarily.

### 4) Generators output data + metadata, not just geometry
A generated dungeon room isn't just coordinates — it has a *type* (shrine, barracks, treasury), a *difficulty*, a *theme*. Downstream systems (enemy placement, loot, lighting) read this metadata. Always annotate output.

### 5) Address the oatmeal problem
If 100 generated levels feel interchangeable, the generator has failed regardless of parametric diversity. Focus variation on **axes players notice**: layout topology, encounter composition, pacing rhythm, visual theme — not room dimensions or exact tile positions.

---

## Required Workflow For Any Request

### Pass 0 — Understand the content + context (fast)
Before choosing an algorithm:
- **What content type?** (dungeon, terrain, cave, placement, loot, waves, names, composite)
- **What game genre and scale?** (roguelike, platformer, open world, mobile puzzle)
- **What are the hard constraints?** (tile-based? real-time generation? chunk-streaming? target platform?)
- **What should the output "feel" like?** (geometric/designed, organic/natural, chaotic/alien, structured/civilized)

### Pass 1 — Select algorithm(s) using the decision guide
Use the **Algorithm Selection Matrix** (Section B) to choose. State your choice and *why it fits this game's character*. If the user has already chosen an algorithm, validate the choice or suggest alternatives.

### Pass 2 — Design the generation pipeline
Most real procgen is a **pipeline**, not a single algorithm:
1. **Structure** — generate the macro layout (rooms, regions, terrain heightmap)
2. **Connectivity** — ensure traversability (paths, corridors, reachability)
3. **Population** — place content within structure (enemies, loot, features)
4. **Validation** — verify output quality (playability, pacing, diversity)
5. **Annotation** — tag output with metadata for downstream systems

State which stages apply and what each produces.

### Pass 3 — Implement with tunable parameters
Every magic number becomes a **named parameter** in a config object with:
- a descriptive name
- a default value
- a valid range
- a comment explaining what it changes about the output character

### Pass 4 — Validate output quality
Add validation appropriate to the content type:
- Dungeons: flood-fill connectivity, room count within range, critical path exists
- Terrain: no impassable barriers blocking required routes, biome distribution within targets
- Loot: no impossible rolls, rarity distribution matches design intent
- Waves: difficulty curve within envelope, no unbeatable compositions

Include a fallback: if validation fails after N attempts, use a known-good template.

### Pass 5 — Performance and integration
- Generation time budget (ms)
- Memory footprint
- GC considerations (pre-allocate grids, pool objects)
- Chunk/streaming compatibility if applicable
- Web Worker offloading for heavy generation

## The Procgen Stack (What You Must Consider)

### A) Primitives — The Foundation Layer

Every generator is built on these. Get them right first.

#### Seeded PRNG (sequential random numbers)

For ordered generation where you consume random values in sequence:

```js
// mulberry32 — fast, good distribution, 32-bit state
function mulberry32(seed) {
  let s = seed | 0;
  return function() {
    s = (s + 0x6D2B79F5) | 0;
    let t = Math.imul(s ^ (s >>> 15), 1 | s);
    t = (t + Math.imul(t ^ (t >>> 7), 61 | t)) ^ t;
    return ((t ^ (t >>> 14)) >>> 0) / 4294967296;
  };
}

// Usage
const rng = mulberry32(12345);
rng(); // 0.0–1.0, deterministic
```

**Utility wrappers (build these once, use everywhere):**
```js
function rngInt(rng, min, max) {
  return min + Math.floor(rng() * (max - min + 1));
}
function rngFloat(rng, min, max) {
  return min + rng() * (max - min);
}
function rngPick(rng, arr) {
  return arr[Math.floor(rng() * arr.length)];
}
function rngShuffle(rng, arr) {
  const a = [...arr];
  for (let i = a.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(rng() * (i + 1));
    [a[i], a[j]] = [a[j], a[i]];
  }
  return a;
}
function rngWeighted(rng, items, weights) {
  const total = weights.reduce((s, w) => s + w, 0);
  let r = rng() * total;
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    r -= weights[i];
    if (r <= 0) return items[i];
  }
  return items[items.length - 1];
}
```

#### Positional Hash (random-access by coordinate)

For infinite/chunked worlds where you need the value at (x, y) without generating everything before it:

```js
// squirrel3-style hash: (position, seed) → well-distributed uint32
function squirrel3(pos, seed = 0) {
  const BIT_NOISE1 = 0x68E31DA4;
  const BIT_NOISE2 = 0xB5297A4D;
  const BIT_NOISE3 = 0x1B56C4E9;
  let m = pos | 0;
  m = Math.imul(m ^ BIT_NOISE1, BIT_NOISE2);
  m = (m + seed) | 0;
  m = Math.imul(m ^ (m >>> 8), BIT_NOISE3);
  m = m ^ (m >>> 8);
  return m >>> 0;
}

// 2D positional hash
function hash2D(x, y, seed) {
  return squirrel3(x + Math.imul(y, 198491317), seed);
}

// Normalized 0–1
function hash2DNorm(x, y, seed) {
  return hash2D(x, y, seed) / 4294967296;
}
```

**When to use which:**
- **Sequential PRNG** → ordered generation (place rooms one by one, roll loot table, pick corridor direction). Output depends on order of consumption.
- **Positional hash** → spatial generation (infinite terrain value at any tile, chunk-independent feature placement). O(1) lookup, order-independent.

#### Seed Hierarchy

For complex worlds, derive child seeds from parent seeds:

```
World Seed (player-entered or random)
  └─ Region Seed = squirrel3(regionIndex, worldSeed)
       └─ Chunk Seed = squirrel3(chunkX + chunkY * LARGE_PRIME, regionSeed)
            └─ Feature Seed = squirrel3(featureIndex, chunkSeed)
```

This lets you regenerate any chunk without regenerating the world.

#### Noise Functions

Noise produces continuous, smooth random values — essential for terrain, density maps, and organic variation.

**Simplex noise** (always prefer over classic Perlin — fewer grid artifacts, better isotropy):

```js
// Use a tested library: simplex-noise (npm) or embed a simplex2D implementation.
// Key: pass a seeded PRNG to the noise constructor.
import { createNoise2D } from 'simplex-noise';
const noise2D = createNoise2D(() => rng()); // seeded!
```

**Noise composition is where the power lives:**

```js
// Fractal Brownian Motion (fBm) — layered octaves
function fbm(x, y, config) {
  const { octaves = 6, lacunarity = 2.0, gain = 0.5, noise } = config;
  let value = 0, amp = 1, freq = 1, maxAmp = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < octaves; i++) {
    value += noise(x * freq, y * freq) * amp;
    maxAmp += amp;
    amp *= gain;
    freq *= lacunarity;
  }
  return value / maxAmp; // normalized -1 to 1
}

// Ridged multifractal — mountain ridges, cave walls
function ridged(x, y, config) {
  const { octaves = 6, lacunarity = 2.0, gain = 0.5, noise } = config;
  let value = 0, amp = 1, freq = 1, prev = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < octaves; i++) {
    let n = 1 - Math.abs(noise(x * freq, y * freq));
    n = n * n * prev; // sharpen ridges, weight by previous octave
    value += n * amp;
    prev = n;
    amp *= gain;
    freq *= lacunarity;
  }
  return value;
}

// Domain warping — feed noise into itself for organic distortion
function domainWarp(x, y, noise, strength = 40) {
  const ox = fbm(x + 0.0, y + 0.0, { octaves: 4, noise });
  const oy = fbm(x + 5.2, y + 1.3, { octaves: 4, noise });
  return fbm(x + ox * strength, y + oy * strength, { octaves: 6, noise });
}
```

**Noise recipe quick reference:**

| Recipe | Use Case | Character |
|---|---|---|
| fBm, 4-6 octaves, gain 0.5 | General terrain, heightmaps | Rolling hills, natural |
| Ridged multifractal | Mountains, cave walls | Sharp peaks, dramatic |
| Domain-warped fBm | Alien terrain, magical areas | Swirling, organic, otherworldly |
| fBm, 1-2 octaves | Biome regions, broad zones | Smooth blobs, gradual transitions |
| noise > threshold | Islands, continent masks | Hard-edged regions |
| noise × radial falloff | Island shape from infinite noise | Bounded landmass |

#### Worley Noise (Voronoi / Cellular)

Produces cell-like, cracked, crystalline patterns — distinct from Perlin/simplex:

```js
function worley2D(x, y, seed, numPoints = 20) {
  let minDist = Infinity;
  // In practice: partition into cells, only check neighboring cells
  for (let i = 0; i < numPoints; i++) {
    const px = hash2DNorm(i, 0, seed) * numPoints;
    const py = hash2DNorm(i, 1, seed) * numPoints;
    const d = (x - px) ** 2 + (y - py) ** 2;
    if (d < minDist) minDist = d;
  }
  return Math.sqrt(minDist);
}
```

Use for: stone textures, cracked earth, cell-based biome boundaries, crystal cave patterns.

---

### B) Algorithm Selection Matrix

**Match content type × desired character → algorithm.**

#### Dungeons & Interior Spaces

| Algorithm | Character | Best For | Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BSP (Binary Space Partition)** | Geometric, rectangular rooms, clean corridors | Traditional roguelikes, office/building layouts | Rooms always axis-aligned, can feel "boxy" |
| **Room Accretion** (Brogue-style) | Organic, connected, varied room shapes | Exploratory roguelikes, interconnected spaces | Harder to control global layout shape |
| **Scatter + Separate + Connect** (Nystrom) | Varied room sizes, natural clustering, loops | Mid-complexity dungeons, Zelda-style maps | Separation physics + Delaunay can be complex |
| **Template Stitch** (Spelunky-style) | Designer-controlled atoms, procedural arrangement | Platformer levels, puzzle rooms, controlled feel | Requires hand-designed room templates |
| **Wave Function Collapse** | Tile-coherent, pattern-consistent | Towns, structured interiors, tiled environments | Can fail (contradiction), expensive, complex to set up |
| **Agent/Drunkard's Walk** | Winding tunnels, cave-like paths | Connecting rooms, mining tunnel feel | Hard to control room size, can produce too-thin paths |

#### Natural Terrain & Caves

| Algorithm | Character | Best For | Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cellular Automata** | Organic blobs, natural cave shapes | Caves, islands, organic regions | Can produce disconnected areas (needs flood-fill) |
| **Noise Thresholding** | Smooth, continental, zoned | Overworld terrain, biome maps, heightmaps | Less structural control than room-based methods |
| **Voronoi + Noise** | Region-based, natural boundaries | Polygon maps, biome systems, political borders | Implementation complexity for polygon operations |
| **Diamond-Square / Midpoint Displacement** | Fractal, mountainous | Quick heightmaps, landscape backgrounds | Grid-size must be 2^n+1, visible artifacts at seams |

#### Placement & Population

| Algorithm | Character | Best For | Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Poisson Disk Sampling** | Even spacing, natural distribution | Trees, rocks, items, enemy spawns, stars | Basic version is rectangular; density variation needs adaptation |
| **Weighted Random with Constraints** | Controlled variety, themed | Enemy composition, loot drops, wave building | Needs careful weight tuning |
| **Noise-Driven Density** | Spatially varying concentration | Forest density, ore veins, population density | Continuous, not discrete; combine with Poisson for placement |

#### Systems & Content

| Algorithm | Character | Best For | Limitations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Weighted Tables + Pity** | Fair, streak-protected randomness | Loot drops, rewards, gacha | Needs state tracking for pity counters |
| **Markov Chains** | Stylistically consistent sequences | Names, text fragments, music phrases | Needs training corpus; can produce nonsense |
| **L-Systems** | Branching, organic growth | Trees, vegetation, fractal structures, rivers | Can be hard to constrain to game grid |
| **Grammar-Based** | Rule-driven, nested structure | Quest generation, narrative beats, recipe creation | Complex rule authoring |

---

### C) Connectivity & Validation (Never Skip This)

**Every spatial generator needs a connectivity check.** Generated content that the player can't traverse is worse than no content.

```js
// Flood fill — find all reachable tiles from a starting point
function floodFill(grid, startX, startY, isPassable) {
  const w = grid[0].length, h = grid.length;
  const visited = Array.from({ length: h }, () => new Uint8Array(w));
  const stack = [[startX, startY]];
  const region = [];
  visited[startY][startX] = 1;

  while (stack.length > 0) {
    const [x, y] = stack.pop();
    region.push([x, y]);
    for (const [dx, dy] of [[1,0],[-1,0],[0,1],[0,-1]]) {
      const nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;
      if (nx >= 0 && nx < w && ny >= 0 && ny < h
          && !visited[ny][nx] && isPassable(grid[ny][nx])) {
        visited[ny][nx] = 1;
        stack.push([nx, ny]);
      }
    }
  }
  return region;
}

// Find all disconnected regions and optionally connect them
function ensureConnectivity(grid, isPassable, setPassable) {
  const w = grid[0].length, h = grid.length;
  const visited = Array.from({ length: h }, () => new Uint8Array(w));
  const regions = [];

  for (let y = 0; y < h; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < w; x++) {
      if (!visited[y][x] && isPassable(grid[y][x])) {
        const region = floodFill(grid, x, y, isPassable);
        region.forEach(([rx, ry]) => visited[ry][rx] = 1);
        regions.push(region);
      }
    }
  }

  if (regions.length <= 1) return regions;

  // Connect each region to the largest via shortest tunnel
  regions.sort((a, b) => b.length - a.length);
  const main = new Set(regions[0].map(([x,y]) => `${x},${y}`));

  for (let r = 1; r < regions.length; r++) {
    // Find closest tile pair between this region and main
    let bestDist = Infinity, bestA, bestB;
    for (const [ax, ay] of regions[r]) {
      for (const key of main) {
        const [bx, by] = key.split(',').map(Number);
        const d = Math.abs(ax - bx) + Math.abs(ay - by);
        if (d < bestDist) { bestDist = d; bestA = [ax, ay]; bestB = [bx, by]; }
      }
    }
    // Carve L-shaped tunnel between bestA and bestB
    carveTunnel(grid, bestA, bestB, setPassable);
    regions[r].forEach(([x,y]) => main.add(`${x},${y}`));
  }
  return regions;
}

function carveTunnel(grid, [ax, ay], [bx, by], setPassable) {
  let x = ax, y = ay;
  while (x !== bx) { setPassable(grid, x, y); x += Math.sign(bx - x); }
  while (y !== by) { setPassable(grid, x, y); y += Math.sign(by - y); }
  setPassable(grid, bx, by);
}
```

**Validation checklist by content type:**

| Content | Must Validate | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Dungeon/cave | All rooms reachable, start→exit path exists, room count in range | Connect isolated regions or regenerate |
| Terrain | Player spawn is traversable, no impassable barriers on required routes | Carve path through barriers |
| Loot table | No impossible rolls, rarity distribution within 10% of target over 10K samples | Clamp weights, add floor probabilities |
| Wave/encounter | Difficulty within envelope, no unbeatable combinations, proper pacing | Substitute known-good template |
| Placement | No overlapping critical objects, minimum spacing respected | Reject and re-place violated items |

---

### D) Pacing, Spatial Grammar & the "Design Surface"

Procgen that produces flat, unpaced content fails even when technically correct.

**Spatial grammar elements (encode these as constraints):**

- **Critical path** — the shortest route from start to goal. Must exist. Must escalate.
- **Gates & keys** — literal (locked door + key) or metaphorical (ability check, puzzle). Create pacing structure.
- **Safe zones** — areas of low threat for the player to regroup. Place after hard sections.
- **Vistas / reveals** — moments where the player sees what's ahead. Place at transitions.
- **Choice points** — where the player picks between paths. Create agency.
- **Loops / shortcuts** — connections back to earlier areas. Reward exploration.

**Difficulty pacing curve:**

```
Intensity
  ▲
  │    ╱╲      ╱╲  ╱╲
  │   ╱  ╲    ╱  ╲╱  ╲      ╱╲
  │  ╱    ╲  ╱         ╲   ╱  ╲
  │ ╱      ╲╱           ╲ ╱    ╲ BOSS
  │╱                     ╲      ╲____
  └──────────────────────────────────▶ Progress
   Intro  Rising  Breather  Climax  Resolution
```

Your generator should produce content that follows a pacing envelope, not a flat line. Assign difficulty/intensity values to generated sections and validate the sequence against a target curve.

**The "Design Surface"** — every generator must expose:

```js
const dungeonConfig = {
  // Structure
  roomCount:     { value: 12, min: 5, max: 30, desc: "Number of rooms to generate" },
  roomSizeMin:   { value: 5,  min: 3, max: 10, desc: "Minimum room dimension (tiles)" },
  roomSizeMax:   { value: 15, min: 8, max: 30, desc: "Maximum room dimension (tiles)" },

  // Character
  loopiness:     { value: 0.15, min: 0, max: 0.5, desc: "Fraction of extra corridors beyond MST (0=tree, 0.5=many loops)" },
  organicness:   { value: 0.3,  min: 0, max: 1,   desc: "Blend between rectangular (0) and organic (1) room shapes" },

  // Pacing
  difficultyRamp:{ value: 1.2, min: 0.5, max: 3, desc: "Difficulty multiplier per room depth from start" },
  safeRoomFreq:  { value: 4,   min: 2,   max: 8, desc: "Place a safe room every N rooms along critical path" },

  // Theming
  biomeWeights:  { value: { cave: 3, temple: 1, flooded: 1 }, desc: "Weighted biome selection for room theming" },
};
```

This is the interface between the generator and the game designer. It must be clear, named, and documented.

---

### E) Chunking & Infinite Generation (JS-Specific)

For worlds larger than a single screen, generate in chunks loaded on demand.

**Core pattern:**

```js
const CHUNK_SIZE = 32; // tiles per chunk side
const chunkCache = new Map(); // "cx,cy" → chunk data

function getChunk(cx, cy, worldSeed) {
  const key = `${cx},${cy}`;
  if (chunkCache.has(key)) return chunkCache.get(key);

  const chunkSeed = squirrel3(cx + Math.imul(cy, 198491317), worldSeed);
  const chunk = generateChunk(cx, cy, chunkSeed);
  chunkCache.set(key, chunk);

  // Evict distant chunks if cache is large
  if (chunkCache.size > MAX_CACHED_CHUNKS) evictDistant(cx, cy);

  return chunk;
}

function generateChunk(cx, cy, chunkSeed) {
  const rng = mulberry32(chunkSeed);
  const tiles = new Uint8Array(CHUNK_SIZE * CHUNK_SIZE);

  for (let ly = 0; ly < CHUNK_SIZE; ly++) {
    for (let lx = 0; lx < CHUNK_SIZE; lx++) {
      const wx = cx * CHUNK_SIZE + lx;
      const wy = cy * CHUNK_SIZE + ly;
      // Use positional hash or noise for terrain — chunk-independent!
      tiles[ly * CHUNK_SIZE + lx] = terrainAt(wx, wy);
    }
  }
  // Use sequential rng for features within chunk (order-dependent)
  placeFeatures(tiles, rng);
  return tiles;
}
```

**Key rules for chunk-based generation:**
- Terrain: use **positional noise/hash** so adjacent chunks are seamless without communication.
- Features (trees, enemies): use the **chunk seed** + sequential PRNG so features are chunk-local and deterministic.
- Cross-chunk structures (rivers, roads): generate at a higher level (region/world) and stamp into chunks.
- **Heavy generation → Web Worker.** Post the seed, receive the chunk data.

## Content-Type Recipe Book

### Recipe 1: BSP Dungeon

Classic rooms-and-corridors dungeon via recursive binary partitioning.

```js
function generateBSPDungeon(width, height, config, seed) {
  const rng = mulberry32(seed);
  const grid = Array.from({ length: height }, () => new Uint8Array(width).fill(1)); // 1=wall

  // Recursively split space
  function split(x, y, w, h, depth) {
    if (depth <= 0 || w < config.roomSizeMin * 2 + 3 || h < config.roomSizeMin * 2 + 3) {
      return [{ x, y, w, h, room: null }];
    }
    const horiz = (w > h) ? rng() < 0.3 : rng() < 0.7; // bias split direction by aspect
    const leaves = [];
    if (horiz) {
      const splitY = y + rngInt(rng, config.roomSizeMin + 1, h - config.roomSizeMin - 1);
      leaves.push(...split(x, y, w, splitY - y, depth - 1));
      leaves.push(...split(x, splitY, w, y + h - splitY, depth - 1));
    } else {
      const splitX = x + rngInt(rng, config.roomSizeMin + 1, w - config.roomSizeMin - 1);
      leaves.push(...split(x, y, splitX - x, h, depth - 1));
      leaves.push(...split(splitX, y, x + w - splitX, h, depth - 1));
    }
    return leaves;
  }

  const leaves = split(0, 0, width, height, config.splitDepth || 5);

  // Place rooms inside leaves
  const rooms = [];
  for (const leaf of leaves) {
    const rw = rngInt(rng, config.roomSizeMin, Math.min(config.roomSizeMax, leaf.w - 2));
    const rh = rngInt(rng, config.roomSizeMin, Math.min(config.roomSizeMax, leaf.h - 2));
    const rx = leaf.x + rngInt(rng, 1, leaf.w - rw - 1);
    const ry = leaf.y + rngInt(rng, 1, leaf.h - rh - 1);
    carveRect(grid, rx, ry, rw, rh);
    rooms.push({ x: rx, y: ry, w: rw, h: rh, cx: rx + (rw >> 1), cy: ry + (rh >> 1) });
  }

  // Connect rooms (L-shaped corridors between neighboring rooms)
  for (let i = 0; i < rooms.length - 1; i++) {
    carveTunnel(grid, [rooms[i].cx, rooms[i].cy], [rooms[i+1].cx, rooms[i+1].cy],
      (g, x, y) => { if (y >= 0 && y < height && x >= 0 && x < width) g[y][x] = 0; });
  }

  return { grid, rooms };
}

function carveRect(grid, x, y, w, h) {
  for (let dy = 0; dy < h; dy++)
    for (let dx = 0; dx < w; dx++)
      grid[y + dy][x + dx] = 0; // 0=floor
}
```

**Tuning:**

| Parameter | Range | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| splitDepth | 3–7 | Fewer splits = fewer, larger rooms |
| roomSizeMin | 3–6 | Minimum room feel (3=closet, 6=chamber) |
| roomSizeMax | 8–20 | Maximum room feel |

**Post-processing:** Add loops (connect non-adjacent rooms at `loopiness` rate). Run flood-fill to verify connectivity.

### Recipe 2: Cellular Automata Caves

Organic cave shapes from iterated local rules.

```js
function generateCACave(width, height, config, seed) {
  const rng = mulberry32(seed);
  const grid = Array.from({ length: height }, () => new Uint8Array(width));

  // Initialize with random fill
  for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
      if (x === 0 || x === width-1 || y === 0 || y === height-1) {
        grid[y][x] = 1; // border is always wall
      } else {
        grid[y][x] = rng() < config.fillRatio ? 1 : 0;
      }
    }
  }

  // Iterate CA rule
  const buf = Array.from({ length: height }, () => new Uint8Array(width));
  for (let iter = 0; iter < config.iterations; iter++) {
    for (let y = 1; y < height - 1; y++) {
      for (let x = 1; x < width - 1; x++) {
        const neighbors = countNeighbors8(grid, x, y);
        // Standard cave rule: B5678/S45678
        if (grid[y][x] === 1) {
          buf[y][x] = neighbors >= config.surviveThreshold ? 1 : 0;
        } else {
          buf[y][x] = neighbors >= config.birthThreshold ? 1 : 0;
        }
      }
    }
    for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) grid[y].set(buf[y]);
  }

  // Connectivity pass — REQUIRED
  ensureConnectivity(grid,
    v => v === 0,
    (g, x, y) => { g[y][x] = 0; }
  );

  return { grid };
}

function countNeighbors8(grid, x, y) {
  let count = 0;
  for (let dy = -1; dy <= 1; dy++)
    for (let dx = -1; dx <= 1; dx++)
      if ((dx || dy) && grid[y + dy][x + dx] === 1) count++;
  return count;
}
```

**Named presets:**

| Preset | fillRatio | birthThreshold | surviveThreshold | iterations | Character |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spacious Cavern** | 0.42 | 5 | 4 | 4 | Large open areas, few pillars |
| **Standard Cave** | 0.48 | 5 | 4 | 5 | Natural cave feel, mixed open/tight |
| **Tight Tunnels** | 0.55 | 6 | 5 | 4 | Narrow, winding passages |
| **Swiss Cheese** | 0.40 | 5 | 3 | 3 | Many small connected pockets |

### Recipe 3: Noise-Based Terrain with Biomes

Elevation + moisture → biome assignment.

```js
function generateTerrain(width, height, config, seed) {
  const rng = mulberry32(seed);
  const elevNoise = createNoise2D(() => rng());
  const moistNoise = createNoise2D(() => rng());

  const elevation = new Float32Array(width * height);
  const moisture  = new Float32Array(width * height);
  const biome     = new Uint8Array(width * height);

  for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
      const i = y * width + x;
      const nx = x / config.scale, ny = y / config.scale;

      elevation[i] = fbm(nx, ny, { octaves: 6, lacunarity: 2, gain: 0.5, noise: elevNoise });
      moisture[i]  = fbm(nx + 100, ny + 100, { octaves: 4, lacunarity: 2, gain: 0.5, noise: moistNoise });

      // Optional: island falloff mask
      if (config.islandFalloff) {
        const dx = (x / width) * 2 - 1, dy = (y / height) * 2 - 1;
        const dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
        elevation[i] -= dist * config.islandFalloff;
      }

      biome[i] = assignBiome(elevation[i], moisture[i]);
    }
  }

  return { elevation, moisture, biome, width, height };
}

// Biome lookup: elevation (rows) × moisture (columns)
const BIOME_TABLE = [
  // low moisture ←→ high moisture
  ['desert',    'grassland', 'forest',    'rainforest' ], // high elevation
  ['desert',    'plains',    'forest',    'swamp'      ], // mid elevation
  ['beach',     'beach',     'marsh',     'marsh'      ], // low elevation
  ['ocean',     'ocean',     'ocean',     'ocean'      ], // below sea level
];

function assignBiome(elev, moist) {
  const eRow = elev > 0.3 ? 0 : elev > 0.0 ? 1 : elev > -0.15 ? 2 : 3;
  const mCol = Math.min(3, Math.max(0, Math.floor((moist + 1) * 2))); // -1..1 → 0..3
  return BIOME_TABLE[eRow][mCol];
}
```

**Tuning:**

| Parameter | Range | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| scale | 50–500 | Smaller = more detailed terrain; larger = broad continents |
| octaves (elevation) | 4–8 | More octaves = finer detail |
| islandFalloff | 0–2 | 0 = no mask, 1+ = island shape |

### Recipe 4: Poisson Disk Placement

Even, natural-looking placement of objects.

```js
// Bridson's algorithm — O(n), seeded
function poissonDisk(width, height, minDist, rng, maxAttempts = 30) {
  const cellSize = minDist / Math.SQRT2;
  const cols = Math.ceil(width / cellSize);
  const rows = Math.ceil(height / cellSize);
  const gridArr = new Int32Array(cols * rows).fill(-1);
  const points = [];
  const active = [];

  function gridIdx(x, y) {
    return Math.floor(x / cellSize) + Math.floor(y / cellSize) * cols;
  }

  // Seed point
  const sx = rng() * width, sy = rng() * height;
  points.push([sx, sy]);
  active.push(0);
  gridArr[gridIdx(sx, sy)] = 0;

  while (active.length > 0) {
    const idx = Math.floor(rng() * active.length);
    const [px, py] = points[active[idx]];
    let found = false;

    for (let a = 0; a < maxAttempts; a++) {
      const angle = rng() * Math.PI * 2;
      const dist = minDist + rng() * minDist;
      const nx = px + Math.cos(angle) * dist;
      const ny = py + Math.sin(angle) * dist;

      if (nx < 0 || nx >= width || ny < 0 || ny >= height) continue;

      const ci = Math.floor(nx / cellSize), cj = Math.floor(ny / cellSize);
      let ok = true;
      for (let di = -2; di <= 2 && ok; di++) {
        for (let dj = -2; dj <= 2 && ok; dj++) {
          const ni = ci + di, nj = cj + dj;
          if (ni >= 0 && ni < cols && nj >= 0 && nj < rows) {
            const pi = gridArr[ni + nj * cols];
            if (pi >= 0) {
              const [qx, qy] = points[pi];
              if ((nx-qx)**2 + (ny-qy)**2 < minDist * minDist) ok = false;
            }
          }
        }
      }
      if (ok) {
        const newIdx = points.length;
        points.push([nx, ny]);
        active.push(newIdx);
        gridArr[ci + cj * cols] = newIdx;
        found = true;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (!found) active.splice(idx, 1);
  }
  return points;
}
```

**Use for:** tree placement, rock scatter, enemy spawn points, star fields, item drops, building placement in towns.

**Varying density:** multiply `minDist` by a spatially-varying factor (e.g., from a noise field) — smaller minDist = denser placement.

### Recipe 5: Weighted Loot Tables with Pity

```js
function createLootTable(entries, seed) {
  // entries: [{ item, weight, rarity }]
  const rng = mulberry32(seed);
  let pityCounter = 0;

  function roll(pityThreshold = 20, pityBonus = 5) {
    const boostedEntries = entries.map(e => ({
      ...e,
      effectiveWeight: e.weight * (e.rarity === 'rare' && pityCounter >= pityThreshold
        ? pityBonus : 1)
    }));

    const total = boostedEntries.reduce((s, e) => s + e.effectiveWeight, 0);
    let r = rng() * total;

    for (const entry of boostedEntries) {
      r -= entry.effectiveWeight;
      if (r <= 0) {
        if (entry.rarity === 'rare') pityCounter = 0;
        else pityCounter++;
        return entry.item;
      }
    }
    return entries[entries.length - 1].item;
  }

  return { roll };
}

// Usage
const chestLoot = createLootTable([
  { item: 'gold_small',   weight: 50, rarity: 'common' },
  { item: 'potion',       weight: 25, rarity: 'common' },
  { item: 'weapon_basic', weight: 15, rarity: 'uncommon' },
  { item: 'weapon_rare',  weight: 7,  rarity: 'rare' },
  { item: 'legendary',    weight: 3,  rarity: 'rare' },
], seed);
```

**Tuning:**

| Parameter | Range | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| pityThreshold | 10–50 | Rolls before pity kicks in (lower = more generous) |
| pityBonus | 2–10 | Multiplier on rare weights when pity active |
| base weights | ratio matters, not absolute | 50:25:15:7:3 ≈ 50% common, 25% potion, etc. |

### Recipe 6: Wave / Encounter Composition

```js
function generateWave(waveNumber, config, seed) {
  const rng = mulberry32(seed + waveNumber);
  const budget = config.baseBudget + waveNumber * config.budgetPerWave;

  const enemies = [];
  let spent = 0;

  // Pick from enemy roster, respecting budget
  const roster = config.enemyRoster
    .filter(e => e.minWave <= waveNumber) // unlock enemies over time
    .sort((a, b) => b.cost - a.cost);     // try expensive first

  while (spent < budget) {
    const affordable = roster.filter(e => e.cost <= budget - spent);
    if (affordable.length === 0) break;
    const pick = rngWeighted(rng, affordable, affordable.map(e => e.weight));
    enemies.push(pick);
    spent += pick.cost;
  }

  // Validate: ensure wave isn't empty and isn't impossible
  if (enemies.length === 0) enemies.push(roster[roster.length - 1]); // cheapest

  return {
    wave: waveNumber,
    enemies,
    totalBudget: budget,
    spent,
    spawnDelay: Math.max(config.minSpawnDelay, config.baseSpawnDelay - waveNumber * config.spawnAccel),
  };
}
```

### Recipe 7: Markov Chain Name Generator

```js
function buildMarkovChain(corpus, order = 2) {
  const chain = new Map();
  for (const word of corpus) {
    const padded = '^'.repeat(order) + word.toLowerCase() + '$';
    for (let i = 0; i < padded.length - order; i++) {
      const key = padded.slice(i, i + order);
      const next = padded[i + order];
      if (!chain.has(key)) chain.set(key, []);
      chain.get(key).push(next);
    }
  }
  return chain;
}

function generateName(chain, order, rng, minLen = 3, maxLen = 12) {
  let result = '';
  let state = '^'.repeat(order);

  for (let i = 0; i < maxLen; i++) {
    const options = chain.get(state);
    if (!options) break;
    const next = options[Math.floor(rng() * options.length)];
    if (next === '$') { if (result.length >= minLen) break; else continue; }
    result += next;
    state = state.slice(1) + next;
  }

  return result.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + result.slice(1);
}

// Usage
const townNames = buildMarkovChain([
  'greenfield', 'blackstone', 'riverdale', 'thornwall', 'ashford',
  'ironhold', 'mistwood', 'stormhaven', 'deepwell', 'frostpeak'
], 2);
const rng = mulberry32(42);
generateName(townNames, 2, rng); // "Stornwell", "Deepford", etc.
```

## Output Format (What You Must Deliver)

When responding to a procgen request:

1. **Context check (2-3 bullets):** What content, what game, what constraints?
2. **Algorithm selection:** Which algorithm and *why it matches this game's character.*
3. **Pipeline stages:** What the generation pipeline looks like, stage by stage.
4. **Implementation (JS):** Working code with seeded PRNG, named config parameters, and comments.
5. **Validation:** How output quality is checked and what happens on failure.
6. **Tuning guide:** Parameter table with ranges and descriptions of what each changes.
7. **Perf notes:** Generation time budget, memory, GC concerns, chunking if applicable.

---

## Guardrails & Quality Checks (Mandatory)

### The Oatmeal Check
After implementing, mentally generate 10 outputs. Would a player notice they're different? If not, increase variation on the axes that matter (topology, pacing, theme) not the axes that don't (exact coordinates, tile-level noise).

### The Playability Check
Every generated level/world must be validated for:
- Reachability (can the player get from start to end?)
- Fairness (is it possible to win with expected skill?)
- Completeness (are all required elements present?)

### The Performance Budget
- **Real-time generation** (during gameplay): <16ms for a screen-sized chunk
- **Level transition** (loading screen acceptable): <500ms for a full level
- **World init** (game start): <2s for initial world structure
- If generation exceeds budget: use Web Worker, or generate incrementally, or pre-generate during low-activity moments

### The Reproducibility Check
`generate(seed) === generate(seed)` must ALWAYS be true. Test this. Common reproducibility killers:
- `Math.random()` anywhere in the pipeline
- Hash map iteration order (use arrays or Map with deterministic insertion)
- Floating-point order-of-operations differences (rare but real across platforms)
- Object property enumeration order for very old engines

### Fallback Templates
Every generator should have 2-3 hand-designed fallback templates. If validation fails after N regeneration attempts (default: 5), use a template and move on. A known-good level is always better than an infinite regeneration loop.

---

## Perf Notes (JS-Specific)

- **Pre-allocate grids** with typed arrays (`Uint8Array`, `Float32Array`) — avoid nested arrays for large grids.
- **Object pooling** for placed features/entities — reuse objects instead of allocating new ones per generation.
- **Avoid string concatenation** in hot loops (grid key lookups) — use numeric indexing (`y * width + x`).
- **Web Workers** for heavy generation — post the seed and config, receive the result. Keep main thread free.
- **Chunk cache eviction** — for infinite worlds, evict chunks beyond a distance threshold. LRU or distance-based.
- **Never generate what you don't need** — if the player can only see a 20×15 tile viewport, don't generate a 1000×1000 grid upfront. Generate on demand.

---

## Connecting Procgen to Game Feel

Generated content needs **extra communication** because it lacks hand-tuned visual/behavioral cues.

- **Map generator parameters to visible properties.** A 2× health enemy should be visibly larger/recolored. A rare loot drop should glow. A hard-generated room should have different lighting.
- **Annotate output with difficulty/rarity for the juice layer.** If the generation system tags a room as "boss arena," the game-adding-juice system can add environmental effects (fog, particles, camera changes).
- **Procedural variation must be readable.** If the player can't perceive the difference between generated variants, the variation is wasted. Focus on changes that affect silhouette, color, behavior, or spatial layout — not sub-pixel differences.

See the `game-adding-juice` skill for feedback implementation patterns.
