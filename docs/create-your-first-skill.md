# Create Your First Skill

Use this tutorial when you want to add a brand new skill to Vasir and verify the full authoring loop end-to-end.

## What you will accomplish

You will create a minimal skill, register it, and prove that the catalog and repo checks accept it.

## Audience

This tutorial assumes you can edit files in the repo and run the npm scripts already used by Vasir.

## Prerequisites

- You are inside the Vasir repo.
- Node 18.20 or later within 18.x, or Node 20.10 or newer is installed.
- Git is available on `PATH`.

## Step 1: Choose one failure mode and one skill name

Pick a single recurring failure mode that a base model gets wrong often enough to deserve a reusable control surface.

For this tutorial, use the placeholder skill name `example-repo-constraints`.

Expected result:

- You can state the skill in one sentence: what it fixes and when to use it.

## Step 2: Create the skill directory

Create:

```text
.agents/skills/example-repo-constraints/
```

Expected result:

- The new skill has its own flat directory directly under `.agents/skills/`.

## Step 3: Add `SKILL.md`

Create `.agents/skills/example-repo-constraints/SKILL.md` and keep it dense:

````markdown
---
name: example-repo-constraints
description: Repo-specific constraints that keep generated code inside the supported architecture.
category: infra
tags:
  - architecture
  - constraints
recommends: []
version: 0.1.0

# Example Repo Constraints

## Core Principle

All generated work must obey the repo's architectural invariants before convenience or speed.

## Quick Reference

- Route all public behavior through the canonical boundary.
- Fail closed when invariants are unclear.

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1

```js
export function example() {
  return "Replace this with real repo-specific guidance.";
}
```

## Anti-Patterns

- Do not add alternate entrypoints for the same capability.
- Do not document guesses as if they were verified facts.

## Checklist

- [ ] Root invariant is explicit
- [ ] At least one concrete example exists
- [ ] At least two anti-patterns are named
````

Expected result:

- The root skill is specific enough to change model behavior, not just describe a folder, and the catalog metadata lives in the same file.

## Step 4: Rebuild the registry

Run:

```bash
npm run build:registry
```

Expected result:

- `registry.json` now includes `example-repo-constraints`.

## Step 5: Run the repo checks

Run:

```bash
npm run check:registry
npm run check:agents
npm test
```

Expected result:

- Registry and root template projections match their sources.
- The nested-file replacement safety and named-group tests pass.
- Review newly added Markdown links separately; this local package's test suite does not validate them.

## Step 6: Decide whether the root skill is too broad

If the root skill is getting bloated:

1. Keep the root `SKILL.md` focused on the default path.
2. Move framework or environment variants into `references/`.
3. Rebuild `registry.json` so the inferred file inventory picks up the new files.

Expected result:

- The root skill stays sharp and scan-friendly.

## Final outcome

You now have a checked-in skill that appears in the registry and passes the repo validation path.

## Next steps

- Use [docs/writing-skills.md](./writing-skills.md) for the authoring workflow.
- Use [docs/skill-reference.md](./skill-reference.md) when you need field-level facts.
- Use `meta.json` only when maintaining an older skill that still keeps compatibility metadata there. New skills do not need it.
- If you want `vasir eval run <skill>` to work for this skill, add `.agents/skills/<name>/evals/suite.json` plus a short `.agents/skills/<name>/evals/README.md` that explains the failure mode and win condition.
