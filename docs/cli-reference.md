# Vasir CLI Reference

Use this page when you need facts about commands, flags, JSON output, filesystem layout, or the supported CLI override surface.

## Install

Requires Node 18.20 or later within 18.x, or Node 20.10 or newer. Install the local archive in your chosen project:

```sh
npm install --offline --no-audit --no-fund /absolute/path/vasir-slim-0.1.0-slim.2.tgz
./node_modules/.bin/vasir --version
```

The dependency is bundled. See [local installation and pnpm instructions](../README.md#local-install).

## Commands

| Command | Syntax | What it does |

### `status`

- Purpose: inspect-first, zero-risk visibility into what Vasir would do next.
- Result:
  - reports whether the global catalog is current, missing, outdated, or unhealthy
  - reports whether the current repo is tracked, needs adoption, needs repair, or is not initialized
  - reports tracked vs unmanaged local skills and the next safe action
  - reports the repo config path when the repo is already tracked
- Notes:
  - Plain `vasir` defaults to `vasir status`.
  - `status` never copies, deletes, or repairs files.
  - Pass `--repo-root <path>` when you want to inspect an explicit subproject root.

Examples:

```bash
vasir
vasir status
vasir status --json
vasir status --repo-root packages/web
```

### `context`

- Purpose: give humans and LLMs one local-only command that explains how to operate in the current repo.
- Result:
  - returns repo facts already on disk: repo root, package summary, top-level entries, and README excerpt
  - returns the relevant root, nested root, and routed folder `AGENTS.md` files
  - returns the repo's tracked skills, installed skills, explained recommended skills to load first, and the next safe Vasir commands
  - returns an explicit execution contract saying the command is local-only and does not use a model, token, or network
- Notes:
  - `context` is read-only.
  - `context` reads the bundled catalog or a local override source directly; it does not need the global cache under `~/.agents/vasir`.
  - `context` is the intended LLM handshake command.
  - `recommendedSkills[]` are structured objects with `skillName`, `score`, `reasons[]`, and `matchedSignals[]`.
  - `recommendedSkillNames[]` is a convenience mirror of the selected recommendation list.
  - `--debug` adds timing detail, routed path hints, profile inference evidence, and the top candidate recommendation set.
  - Pass `--repo-root <path>` when you want to inspect an explicit subproject root.

Examples:

```bash
vasir context
vasir context --json
vasir context --json --debug
vasir context --repo-root packages/web
```

### `doctor`

- Purpose: diagnose repo drift and operator-facing repair needs.
- Result:
  - checks the global cache state
  - checks global and project alias health
  - checks whether the repo needs adoption or install-state repair
  - checks whether tracked skills are blocked from safe replacement
- Notes:
  - `doctor` is read-only.
  - Use it when `status` says a repo needs attention or when `update` fails closed.

Examples:

```bash
vasir doctor
vasir doctor --json
```

### `repair`

- Purpose: one-command recovery when the repo's Vasir metadata or alias structure drifted.
- Result:
  - repairs `.claude/skills` and `.codex/skills` to point at `.agents/skills` when that is safe
  - rebuilds `.agents/vasir.json` when the repo's explicit tracking policy is missing or invalid
  - rebuilds `.agents/vasir-install-state.json` when the install snapshot is missing or invalid
  - restores missing tracked skills from the installed Vasir bundle
- Notes:
  - `repair` is repo-local only.
  - `repair` preserves explicit repo intent when `.agents/vasir.json` is valid.
  - `repair` does not auto-upgrade already-present skill content to newer Vasir versions; use `vasir diff` and `vasir update` for that.
  - If a tracked skill has safe-to-detect local edits and the existing install snapshot is still valid, `repair` leaves that skill blocked instead of silently blessing the edits.

Examples:

```bash
vasir repair
vasir repair --json
vasir repair --repo-root packages/web
```

### `diff`

- Purpose: review exactly what `vasir update` would change in the current repo before mutating anything.
- Result:
  - compares the repo's tracked `.agents/skills/**` tree against the installed Vasir bundle or local override source
  - shows pending new skills, modified tracked files, blocked updates, and already-current requested skills
  - emits unified text diffs for modified text files and file-level summaries for added or removed files
- Notes:
  - `diff` is read-only.
  - By default, `vasir diff` shows only pending tracked changes and blocked skills.
  - Pass one or more skill names to review only specific tracked skills, including an already-current skill.
  - `--exit-code` returns `1` when tracked changes or blocked skills exist, and `0` when the requested diff set is already current.
  - Pass `--repo-root <path>` when you want to inspect an explicit subproject root.

Examples:

```bash
vasir diff
vasir diff code-auditing
vasir diff --json
vasir diff --exit-code
vasir diff --repo-root packages/web
```

### `init`

- Purpose: make first success obvious.
- Result:
  - Outside a repo: `~/.agents/vasir` exists and `~/.claude/vasir` and `~/.codex/vasir` point to it.
  - Inside a repo: the same global cache is prepared, then the full catalog is copied into that repo under `.agents/skills` and the repo is marked to keep tracking the full catalog on future `vasir update` runs.
- Notes:
  - Vasir copies the catalog from the installed package bundle by default.
  - Inside a repo, `init` is the pit-of-success command when you want “just give this repo everything and keep it current.”
  - If the global cache is dirty or contains manual files, `init` moves it aside to `~/.agents/vasir.dirty-backup.<timestamp>` and rebuilds a clean cache.
  - Pass `--repo-root <path>` when you want to initialize a nested package or subproject explicitly.

Examples:

```bash
vasir init
vasir init --repo-root packages/web
```

### `update`

- Purpose: refresh the canonical global catalog and, when applicable, refresh the current repo's installed Vasir skills from it.
- Result:
  - `~/.agents/vasir` syncs to the currently installed bundled catalog, or bootstraps if missing.
  - If the current repo tracks the full catalog, `update` refreshes existing skills and installs any new Vasir skills added since the last repo sync.
  - If the current repo tracks only a selected installed subset, `update` refreshes only that subset.
- Notes:
  - Fails closed if the existing global cache is dirty.
  - Uses the current repo root as the nearest parent containing `.git`, unless `--repo-root <path>` is provided.
  - `vasir init` marks a repo as full-catalog tracking.
  - `vasir add <skill>` marks a repo as selected-subset tracking.
  - `vasir add all` also marks a repo as full-catalog tracking.
  - `vasir remove <skill>` from a full-catalog repo switches that repo back to selected-subset tracking so the removed skill does not come back unexpectedly.
  - Local edits to a managed skill still fail closed, the same way `vasir add <skill> --replace` does.
  - If the global cache is dirty or contains manual files, `update` moves it aside to `~/.agents/vasir.dirty-backup.<timestamp>` and rebuilds a clean cache.
  - `--dry-run` shows which repo-local skills would update, which are already current, which are blocked by local edits, and whether the global cache would be quarantined, without mutating the cache or repo.

Example:

```bash
vasir update
vasir update --dry-run
vasir update --repo-root packages/web
```

### `list`

- Purpose: inspect the catalog currently installed in `~/.agents/vasir`.
- Result: skill names grouped by category, or a JSON catalog when `--json` is set.
- Notes:
  - Auto-initializes the global catalog if it is missing.

Example:

```bash
vasir list
```

### `groups`

Named groups are a shortcut for selecting skills. Repeated `--group` flags combine their members into a deduplicated union, and you can mix individual skill names with groups. Group selection does not select an AGENTS profile or model routing. Use `--agents-profile frontend` explicitly when you want the optional frontend root-contract scaffold.

```sh
npm exec -- vasir groups
npm exec -- vasir groups gamedev
npm exec -- vasir groups --json
npm exec -- vasir add --group base --group frontend --repo-root /path/to/project
npm exec -- vasir add --group gamedev --repo-root /path/to/project
npm exec -- vasir add --group base --group frontend --group gamedev --repo-root /path/to/project
npm exec -- vasir add code-auditing --group frontend --repo-root /path/to/project
npm exec -- vasir add --group frontend --agents-profile frontend --repo-root /path/to/project
```

Groups expand to tracked individual skill snapshots when you run `add`. Later `update` refreshes the tracked skills; editing a group definition does not automatically install new group members. To select current members when some are already installed, run `npm exec -- vasir add --group <name> --replace --repo-root /path/to/project`. Replacement succeeds for unchanged tracked files; local edits still block replacement. Use `update` for routine refreshes. `remove` remains per-skill. `all` cannot be combined with groups or individual skills.

For a globally installed CLI, use the same commands directly: `vasir groups` and `vasir add --group base --group frontend --repo-root /path/to/project`.

Group definitions live in the repository's root `skill-groups.json`. To add a named group, add a key under `groups` with a `description` and a `skills` array of canonical IDs from the catalog; to edit a group, change those fields. Keep `schemaVersion: 1`, use lowercase hyphenated group names, and list each member once. The CLI validates definitions against the bundled registry before installing. This changes selection metadata without editing any skill content. Install dependencies with `npm ci`, inspect definitions with `node bin/vasir.js groups`, and use `npm pack` to create an archive. Update the documented memberships and regenerate the public review catalog when changing group definitions.

### base (11 skills)

General planning, documentation, debugging, review, and proof skills for any engineering project.

- `documentation-writing`
- `doc-guard-drift`
- `writing-response-quality-style-guide`
- `code-fixing-bugs`
- `code-auditing`
- `plan-maintain-work-spec`
- `plan-question-spec`
- `eval-design-proof-gates`
- `testing-auditing`
- `prompt-perform-root-cause-analysis`
- `plan-project-milestones`

### frontend (5 skills)

Frontend foundations, interface implementation, data visualization, typography, and animation.

- `design-frontend-foundations`
- `design-building-frontend-interfaces`
- `design-visualizing-data`
- `design-designing-typography`
- `design-animating-interfaces`

### gamedev (29 skills)

Game design, playable builds, systems, AI, art, onboarding, QA, 3D performance, MMO analysis, and social loops. All 29 are restored source imports pending content review, including `product-designing-viral-social-loops`. See the [complete membership](../README.md#gamedev-29-skills) or run `vasir groups gamedev`. Combining `base`, `frontend`, and `gamedev` selects 45 distinct skills.

### `add`

- Purpose: copy individual skills or the deduplicated union of selected groups into the current repo root.
- Result:
  - `.agents/skills/<name>/...` is created in the resolved repo root.
  - `.claude/skills` and `.codex/skills` are repaired as aliases to `.agents/skills`.
  - `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are copied into the repo root when no root contract already exists, using the canonical templates plus an inferred stack snippet when the repo shape is obvious, or the canonical templates alone when it is not.
- Notes:
  - The repo root is the nearest parent containing `.git`.
  - If no `.git` ancestor exists, the current working directory is used.
  - `--repo-root <path>` overrides that detection and treats the provided directory as the repo root.
  - Use `vasir add all` when you want every catalog skill copied into the current repo.
  - `vasir add all` marks the repo to keep tracking the full catalog on later `vasir update` runs.
  - `vasir add <specific skills>` marks the repo to keep tracking only those installed skills on later `vasir update` runs.
  - Existing project-local skills are never overwritten unless `--replace` is explicitly provided.
  - Pass `--agents-profile backend`, `--agents-profile frontend`, `--agents-profile ios`, or `--agents-profile generic` when you want to override inference and force a specific root-contract profile.
  - If you pass `--agents-profile` and `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` already exists, the command fails closed unless `--replace` is explicitly provided.
  - Repeat `--group <name>` to combine groups, optionally with individual skill names. Unknown groups or invalid definitions fail before project writes.
  - Groups expand to tracked individual skills; see `groups` above for update and removal semantics.
  - `all` cannot be combined with groups or specific skill names in the same command.

Examples:

```bash
vasir add design-building-frontend-interfaces
vasir add all
vasir add --group base --group frontend --repo-root /path/to/project
vasir add --group frontend --agents-profile frontend --repo-root /path/to/project
vasir add design-building-frontend-interfaces --agents-profile frontend
vasir add code-fixing-bugs testing-enforcing-mandate
```

Text-mode success output also prints the resolved project skills directory so you can see exactly where Vasir wrote files.

### `adopt`

- Purpose: bring an existing `.agents/skills` tree under Vasir management without copying or overwriting files.
- Result:
  - rebuilds `.agents/vasir-install-state.json` from the current on-disk skill directories
  - writes `.agents/vasir.json` as the explicit repo tracking and AGENTS profile contract
  - repairs `.claude/skills` and `.codex/skills` to point at `.agents/skills`
  - infers `trackingMode` from the adopted Vasir skill set
- Notes:
  - Use this when a repo already contains `.agents/skills` from an older workflow but Vasir does not recognize it as managed.
  - Unknown local directories are left in place and reported as unmanaged; Vasir only adopts skill names that exist in the current catalog.
  - `adopt` mutates only local tracking metadata and aliases. It does not copy from the global catalog and does not overwrite local skill files.

Examples:

```bash
vasir adopt
vasir adopt --json
vasir adopt --repo-root packages/web
```

### `remove`

- Purpose: delete one or more project-local skills from the resolved repo root.
- Result:
  - `.agents/skills/<name>` is removed when it exists.
  - `.agents/vasir-install-state.json` is updated so Vasir stops tracking the removed skill.
  - `.claude/skills` and `.codex/skills` keep pointing at `.agents/skills`.
- Notes:
  - The repo root is the nearest parent containing `.git`.
  - If no `.git` ancestor exists, the current working directory is used.
  - `--repo-root <path>` overrides that detection and treats the provided directory as the repo root.
  - If you omit skill names in an interactive terminal, Vasir opens a multi-select prompt over the installed project-local skills.
  - Removing a missing skill is a clean no-op and is reported back in the command result.
  - Removing a skill from a repo that was tracking the full catalog switches that repo back to selected-subset tracking so later `vasir update` runs do not reinstall the removed skill.
  - Generated root contracts are not edited automatically; remove or update any routing to the deleted skill yourself.

Examples:

```bash
vasir remove design-building-frontend-interfaces
vasir remove design-building-frontend-interfaces testing-enforcing-mandate
vasir remove
```

## Agents

`vasir agents` exists for one generated path: make root and nested root `AGENTS.md` + `CLAUDE.md` pairs obvious to create, refresh, and keep aligned.

Folder `AGENTS.md` files are different. They are hand-authored steering maps for ordinary subtrees. Do not generate them with `vasir agents sync --scope`; use the installed `agents-creating-folder-agents` skill or edit the folder file directly.

### `agents sync`

- Purpose: the one-command generated AGENTS/CLAUDE path for normal repos and nested app/package roots.
- Result:
  - renders `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` from the current canonical templates and the inferred or explicit profile
  - stores explicit root profile intent in `.agents/vasir.json`, not in generated root contract files
  - projects optional `agents.modelRouting` policy from `.agents/vasir.json` into the generated contracts; this persistent source configuration is not edited in generated roots
  - fills the purpose paragraph from deterministic local repo context without a model call
  - generates marked routing from existing repo directories
  - injects repo-owned non-obvious constraints from `AGENTS__non-obvious.md`
  - validates both generated contracts before writing either file; each must fit within 32 KiB of UTF-8 text
- Notes:
  - By default, sync targets the resolved repo root.
  - Use `--scope <path>` when a folder is a nested app/package root, such as `frontend/AGENTS.md` + `frontend/CLAUDE.md` or `apps/web/AGENTS.md` + `apps/web/CLAUDE.md`.
  - Use `--profile frontend`, `--profile backend`, `--profile ios`, or `--profile generic` when inference is wrong or when the scope is mixed.
  - Model routing is optional and host-specific. Configure roles under `agents.modelRouting.codex` or `agents.modelRouting.claude`; supported roles are `default`, `planning`, `execution`, `subagent`, `review`, and `design`. A descriptor has a `model` and optional `reasoningEffort`, `host` (`codex` or `claude`), and explicit `fallback` descriptor. The descriptor host defaults to the current consumer; a fallback host defaults to its primary descriptor's host. Missing roles inherit the configured host default; with no host block, the current host applies. An explicit user model choice takes precedence. No fallback is inferred.
  - Vasir checks routing descriptor structure, not model availability. The selected host validates model IDs and supported reasoning efforts. A project setting does not automatically change a running main chat's model. Cross-host work must use an authorized runner, handoff, or delegation; never send a provider's model ID to another provider's selector. If the primary is unavailable, use only its configured fallback and disclose the original choice, fallback, and reason. If the fallback also fails, report the limitation without inventing further routes or unbounded retries. The `design` role covers design deliverables and decisions, including product, UI/UX, visual, interaction, and architecture design; routine implementation uses `execution`. Vasir does not write host runtime files or change host permissions.
  - Sync is deterministic and makes no model calls. It projects the configured routing policy into the generated contracts.
  - For nested scopes, sync overlays `modelRouting` host and role entries from root through the scoped `.agents/vasir.json`. An omitted role inherits the nearest parent choice, then the host's configured default; a missing host uses the current host.
  - Use `vasir agents sync --dry-run` to preview without writing.
  - The legacy positional profile form, such as `vasir agents sync frontend`, still works, but new scripts should use `--profile`.
  - If `AGENTS__non-obvious.md` is missing, sync creates it. Existing `.agents/non-obvious.md` sidecars are moved to the root file, and legacy manual `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` files can seed the root file from the old non-obvious block.
  - Skill catalog updates remain separate: use `vasir update` for tracked `.agents/skills/**` content.

Examples:

```bash
vasir agents sync
vasir agents sync --dry-run
vasir agents sync --profile frontend
vasir agents sync --profile generic
vasir agents sync --scope frontend
vasir agents sync --scope packages/web --profile frontend
vasir agents sync --scope services/api --profile backend
```

See [the project model-routing example](./example-agents.md#model-routing) for a complete `.agents/vasir.json` and the limits of host-side model selection.

### `agents init`

- Purpose: write canonical `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` starters into the resolved repo root with selected profile content composed in.
- Result:
  - `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` exist in the resolved repo root.
  - Both files have the guessed project name filled in.
  - Both files use the current root operating-contract templates.
  - The `Purpose` block and routing block are still safe placeholders until you replace them manually or via `draft-purpose --write` and `draft-routing --write`.
- Notes:
  - Supported profiles are `backend`, `frontend`, `ios`, and `generic`.
  - The repo root is the nearest parent containing `.git`, unless `--repo-root <path>` is provided.
  - If `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` already exists, the command fails closed unless `--replace` is explicitly provided.

Examples:

```bash
vasir agents init backend
vasir agents init frontend --replace
```

### `agents draft-purpose`

- Purpose: inspect the current repo and draft a repo-specific opening paragraph for `AGENTS.md`.
- Result:
  - Prints a 2-3 sentence `Purpose` draft based on local repo context.
  - When `--write` is set, replaces the untouched Vasir placeholder in `AGENTS.md` and an untouched corresponding `CLAUDE.md` purpose when present. A customized Claude purpose is preserved.
- Notes:
  - Reads repo-local context such as the root name, top-level entries, `package.json`, and the first screen of `README.md` when present.
  - Defaults to `openai:gpt-5.4`.
  - Accepts the same single-model override surface as eval: `--model openai`, `--model opus`, `--model mock`, or `--model <provider:model>`.
  - `--write` fails closed if the purpose placeholder has already been edited. In that case, paste the printed draft manually.
  - `--model mock` is the zero-cost local smoke-test path for the command.

Examples:

```bash
vasir agents draft-purpose
vasir agents draft-purpose --model mock
vasir agents draft-purpose --write --model openai
```

### `agents draft-routing`

- Purpose: inspect the current repo and draft repo-aware routing for the root contracts.
- Result:
  - Prints a set of local AGENTS routing lanes based on the actual repo directories.
  - When `--write` is set, updates marked routing in the root contracts after preflighting both results.
- Notes:
  - Uses deterministic repo signals such as top-level directories and common stack lanes.
  - Drafted lanes point at real directories first, then expect a local `AGENTS.md` inside those directories if the lane truly needs local steering rules.
  - Routing markers are permanent composition seams. Keep them; create any explicitly required local `AGENTS.md` files or adjust the routes to the actual guidance available.

Examples:

```bash
vasir agents draft-routing
vasir agents draft-routing --write
```

### `agents validate`

- Purpose: check both root contracts before treating them as finished.
- Result:
  - Accepts completed, well-formed composition markers and checks `CLAUDE.md` when present; legacy AGENTS-only repositories remain supported.
  - Reports file-specific issues for unfinished placeholders, malformed markers, broken routes, and rendered contracts exceeding 32 KiB.
  - For twins identified by Vasir's generation header and consumer block, reports differences in shared policy, including profile guidance. Provider adapters, purpose, non-obvious context, and local routing may differ. Unmarked legacy/manual files are not subjected to shared-policy comparison.
- Notes:
  - `agents sync` runs this check automatically.
  - Use `--scope <path>` to validate a generated nested root AGENTS file such as `frontend/AGENTS.md`.
  - This is still useful after manual edits or lower-level `agents init`, `agents draft-purpose --write`, and `agents draft-routing --write` flows.
  - Common failures include `[Project Name]`, `[Example]`, untouched placeholder content, missing routed directories, and routes requiring a local `AGENTS.md` that does not exist. The markers themselves are valid when their structure and content are complete.

Examples:

```bash
vasir agents validate
vasir agents validate --scope frontend
vasir agents validate --json
```

## Eval

This reviewed local release does not ship eval suites. Examples in this section require a consumer-authored `.agents/skills/<skill>/evals/suite.json` beside the installed skill; inspect and rescore also require a saved run. The sample `testing-enforcing-mandate` command is illustrative and cannot run unchanged against the exported pack. No behavioral skill trials were performed for this release.

`vasir eval run <skill>` is the one-command developer workflow for measuring whether a skill improved steering.

```bash
vasir eval run testing-enforcing-mandate
```

What it does:

- Resolves the skill from the local repo first:
  - `.agents/skills/<skill>/...` when the current repo already contains that skill, whether you are editing the source catalog in Vasir or evaluating an installed project-local copy
  - falls back to the global catalog copy if neither local path exists
- Loads the built-in suite that lives beside that resolved skill source:
  - `.agents/skills/<skill>/evals/suite.json`
  - the matching global catalog skill directory when falling back globally
- Runs the same case set twice for every configured model:
  - baseline: no skill
  - treatment: with the skill
- Repeats every model/case baseline-vs-treatment pair 3 times by default so a single lucky sample does not dominate the result.
- Launches the planned model/case/condition rows with bounded concurrency and streams completion progress.
- On TTYs, renders a live animated spinner/progress row while the batch is in flight.
- Scores every output with built-in hard checks from each case's `requiredSubstrings` and `forbiddenSubstrings`.
- Every case must define at least one hard check. `judgePrompt` augments that floor; it does not replace it.
- If the suite defines `judgePrompt`, Vasir also runs the fixed OpenAI + Anthropic pairwise judges on top of that hard-check floor.
- Stores local run history under `.agents/vasir-evals/<skill>/...`.
- Prints a compact narrative summary first:
  - overall verdict
  - a short summary generated from the saved eval facts, using an LLM when available
  - a few decisive reasons
  - the next recommended action
- Points you to `vasir eval inspect <skill> [run-id]` for the full pair-level drill-down.
- Prints usage totals when the provider reports them.
- Marks the run `COMPLETE` or `INCOMPLETE` and keeps successful rows even if some provider rows fail.

- Create `keys.json` at the repo root using the fields documented in [provider configuration](../cli/eval/provider-config.js).
- Supported keys are:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - `OPENAI_BASE_URL`
  - `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`
- Environment variables still work and win over `keys.json`.
- Interactive prompting only fills keys that are still missing after env vars and `keys.json` are applied.

Built-in defaults:

- `openai:gpt-5.4`
- `anthropic:claude-opus-4-6`

Override surface:

- Pass `--model openai` for only OpenAI with the default model.
- Pass `--model opus` for only Anthropic Opus 4.6.
- Pass `--model mock` for a zero-cost local smoke test.
- Pass `--model <provider:model>` for an explicit full descriptor.
- Repeat `--model` to evaluate multiple explicit models in one run.
- Pass `--trials <count>` to override the default 3-trial run plan.

Examples:

```bash
vasir eval run testing-enforcing-mandate

# repo-local wrapper with the same built-in defaults
npm run eval testing-enforcing-mandate

# inspect the latest saved testing-enforcing-mandate eval
vasir eval inspect testing-enforcing-mandate

# rescore the latest saved testing-enforcing-mandate eval with the current scorer
vasir eval rescore testing-enforcing-mandate

# repo-local zero-cost smoke test without the npm -- delimiter
npm run eval testing-enforcing-mandate mock

# only OpenAI gpt-5.4
vasir eval run testing-enforcing-mandate --model openai

# zero-cost local smoke test
vasir eval run testing-enforcing-mandate --model mock

# explicit multi-model override
vasir eval run testing-enforcing-mandate --model openai:gpt-5.4 --model anthropic:claude-opus-4-6
```

Notes:

- The built-in eval path is suite-owned and single-shape:
  - every suite defines case-level hard checks
  - a suite may add `judgePrompt` to turn on the fixed OpenAI + Anthropic judge layer
- If the fixed judges are unavailable, the hard-check section still renders, but the top-line verdict fails closed to `NO SIGNAL` unless the hard floor itself regresses.
- Older `mode: "command"` and `mode: "judge"` suites are rejected with a migration error. Rewrite them as hard checks plus optional `judgePrompt`.
- The `run` command now optimizes for a short verdict first; use `inspect` when you want the per-pair evidence.
- `run` now defaults to 3 trials per model/case pair. Use `--trials 1` if you want the fastest or cheapest possible check.
- `inspect` reopens a saved run and shows the pair-level swings, the baseline and treatment outputs, and the saved judge reasons when they exist.
- Historical comparisons still use the latest recorded comparable runs behind the summary.
- `rescore` rereads the saved outputs and recomputes `hardScore` with the current scorer. This is the fix path after scorer bugs or scorer improvements.
- Token totals are only available when the provider returns usage. Live OpenAI and Anthropic runs should report them. `--model mock` shows usage as unavailable.
- If a default live provider is missing credentials and the terminal is interactive, Vasir prompts you to paste a key or skip that provider.
- In non-interactive environments, missing live-provider credentials cause those providers to be skipped. If nothing runnable remains, the command fails cleanly and points you to `--model mock`.
- Live provider rows use a request timeout. If a row times out or a provider call fails, the run stays on disk and the final report is marked incomplete instead of discarding the successful rows.
- `npm run eval` prints setup, launches the batch in parallel, streams completions, and accepts positional model shorthands like `npm run eval testing-enforcing-mandate mock` or `npm run eval testing-enforcing-mandate openai`.
- Eval artifacts are tool-owned local files and are ignored by this repo via `.agents/vasir-evals/`.
- Every saved run is stored as a single `run.json` artifact.

## Version

Use this when you need to confirm the installed CLI version before troubleshooting or reporting a bug.

```bash
vasir --version
```

Expected text output:

```text
vasir-slim 0.1.0-slim.2
```

## Replace

`--replace` is the explicit refresh path for an existing project-local skill copy.

```bash
vasir add design-building-frontend-interfaces --replace
```

Facts:

- `--replace` is supported only by `vasir add`.
- Vasir refreshes from the global catalog only when the existing project-local skill still matches the last Vasir-managed snapshot.
- That snapshot lives at `.agents/vasir-install-state.json` in the resolved repo root.
- If the skill directory has local edits, unexpected files, or no tracked snapshot, the command fails closed and tells you to back up or delete the directory manually first.

## Filesystem Contract

Global:

```text
~/.agents/vasir
~/.claude/vasir -> ~/.agents/vasir
~/.codex/vasir -> ~/.agents/vasir
```

Project-local:

```text
.git/
.agents/vasir.json
.agents/vasir-install-state.json
.agents/skills/<name>/
.claude/skills -> .agents/skills
.codex/skills -> .agents/skills
```

Project-local skills are copied files that you own and can edit. They are never linked back to the global catalog.
`.agents/vasir.json` is the committed repo-level source of truth for what the repo wants Vasir to track, which root AGENTS profile it should preserve, and optional project model routing.
`.agents/vasir-install-state.json` is Vasir's operational snapshot of which files it last installed for each project-local skill. Vasir uses it to make `add --replace` fail closed on edited copies, prunes entries automatically when the matching skill directory is gone, and records catalog provenance such as the installed Vasir version, catalog hash, and per-skill source version so `vasir update --dry-run` can explain pending refreshes.

## Advanced Override

`VASIR_REPOSITORY_URL` is a troubleshooting override for local testing or mirror scenarios.
It only accepts a local directory path or `file:///...` URL that already contains `registry.json`, `.agents/skills/`, and `templates/`.

```bash
VASIR_REPOSITORY_URL=file:///absolute/path/to/vasir-fixture-repo vasir init
```

Normal installs should not set it.
