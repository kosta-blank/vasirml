# Troubleshooting Vasir

Use this page when a `vasir` command fails, an alias points at the wrong place, or a project-local skill refuses to refresh.

Every structured CLI error includes a `docsRef` URL that points back to one of the sections on this page or to the CLI reference.

## Node Prerequisites

Use this section for:

- Node runtime or launch failures before Vasir can run normally

Recommended path:

1. Confirm Node 18.20 or later within 18.x, or Node 20.10 or newer is installed.
2. Confirm `node --version` succeeds on your shell `PATH`.
3. Rerun the same `vasir` command.

Verification:

- `node --version` prints a version instead of an error.
- `vasir --version` now runs successfully.

## Unknown Command or Flag

Use this section for:

- `UNKNOWN_COMMAND`
- `UNKNOWN_FLAG`
- `INVALID_COMMAND_FLAG`

Recommended path:

1. Run `vasir --help`.
2. Compare your command against the supported surface in [docs/cli-reference.md](./cli-reference.md#commands).
3. If you wanted a read-only inspection command, use `vasir status` or `vasir doctor`.
4. If you meant to refresh an existing project-local skill, use `vasir add <skill> --replace`.

Verification:

- The retried command matches one of the supported forms in the CLI reference.

## Skill Request Errors

Use this section for:

- `SKILL_NAME_REQUIRED`
- `UNKNOWN_SKILL`
- `DUPLICATE_SKILL_REQUEST`
- `ALL_SKILLS_REQUEST_CONFLICT`

Recommended path:

1. Run `vasir list` to inspect the current catalog.
2. Copy the skill name exactly as listed.
3. Pass each requested skill once.
4. Use `vasir add all` by itself when you want the full catalog.

Verification:

- `vasir add <skill>`, `vasir add all`, or `vasir remove <skill>` succeeds with a listed or installed skill name.

## Status, Doctor, and Adopt

Use this section when:

- `vasir status` says a repo needs adoption
- `vasir doctor` reports alias drift or blocked updates
- a repo already has `.agents/skills/` but `vasir update` says it is not initialized

Recommended path:

1. Start with `vasir status` for the high-level state.
2. Run `vasir context --json --debug` when you want the routed `AGENTS.md` paths, profile inference, and local timing evidence that Vasir is using.
3. Run `vasir doctor` when you need the detailed repair checklist.
4. Run `vasir repair` to rebuild repo metadata, repair aliases, and restore missing tracked skills.
5. Use `vasir adopt` only when you explicitly want the older narrow “snapshot the current tree without copying files” workflow.
6. Run `vasir diff` when you want the exact tracked file changes before mutating the repo.
7. After repair, run `vasir update --dry-run` before `vasir update`.

Verification:

- `vasir status` reports `Repo tracked by Vasir`.
- `.agents/vasir.json` exists and is valid JSON.
- `.agents/vasir-install-state.json` exists and is valid JSON.
- `.claude/skills` and `.codex/skills` resolve to `.agents/skills`.

## Remove and Local State

Use this section when:

- `vasir remove <skill>` did not remove what you expected
- `.agents/vasir-install-state.json` looks stale after manual edits

Recommended path:

1. Prefer `vasir remove <skill>` over manual deletion when you want to remove a project-local skill.
2. If you already deleted `.agents/skills/<skill>` manually, rerun `vasir remove <skill>` once to let Vasir report it as already absent and keep the local snapshot clean.
3. Inspect `.agents/skills/` as the canonical directory. Do not delete from `.claude/skills` or `.codex/skills`; those are aliases.
4. Update generated root contracts yourself if they still route to a removed skill.

Verification:

- `.agents/skills/<skill>` is gone.
- `.claude/skills` and `.codex/skills` still resolve to `.agents/skills`.
- `.agents/vasir.json` reflects the remaining tracked skill policy.
- `.agents/vasir-install-state.json` no longer contains the removed skill entry.

## Global Catalog Problems

Use this section for:

- `CATALOG_SOURCE_UNSUPPORTED`
- `INVALID_GLOBAL_CATALOG`
- `GLOBAL_CATALOG_DIRTY`

Recommended path:

1. Run `vasir update --dry-run` to preview whether Vasir would quarantine and rebuild the cache.
2. Run `vasir init` or `vasir update`. Vasir moves the dirty cache aside to `~/.agents/vasir.dirty-backup.<timestamp>` and rebuilds `~/.agents/vasir` from the installed bundle.
3. If you set `VASIR_REPOSITORY_URL`, confirm it points at a local directory or `file:///...` URL with `registry.json`, `.agents/skills/`, and `templates/`.

Verification:

- `~/.agents/vasir/registry.json` exists and is parseable.
- `~/.agents/vasir/.agents/skills/` exists.
- `~/.agents/vasir/templates/` exists.
- If a dirty cache existed, a sibling `~/.agents/vasir.dirty-backup.<timestamp>` directory contains the previous cache contents.
- `vasir update` succeeds.

If you expected a repo-local skill refresh too, rerun `vasir update` from inside the target repo root or pass `--repo-root <path>`.
- Repos initialized with `vasir init` or `vasir add all` track the full catalog, so `update` also installs newly added Vasir skills.
- Repos initialized with `vasir add <specific skills>` track only that selected subset.
- Run `vasir diff` first when you want to review exact tracked file changes before updating the repo.

## Replace Safety Errors

Use this section for:

- `PROJECT_SKILL_EXISTS`
- `PROJECT_SKILL_UNTRACKED`
- `PROJECT_SKILL_MODIFIED`
- `INVALID_PROJECT_INSTALL_STATE`
- `INVALID_PROJECT_CONFIG`

Recommended path:

1. Decide whether you want to keep the current project-local skill directory.
2. If you want to preserve local edits, back them up first.
3. If you want a fresh Vasir-managed copy, delete the project-local skill directory manually.
4. If `.agents/vasir-install-state.json` or `.agents/vasir.json` is invalid and you want Vasir to rebuild the repo metadata safely, run `vasir repair`.
5. If `.agents/vasir-install-state.json` or `.agents/vasir.json` is invalid and you no longer trust the current tree, delete those files too.
6. Rerun `vasir add <skill>` for a fresh install, or `vasir add <skill> --replace` only after the directory matches the last Vasir-managed snapshot.

Verification:

- The project-local skill directory contains only the files Vasir manages for that skill.
- `.agents/vasir.json` is valid JSON if it exists.
- `.agents/vasir-install-state.json` is valid JSON if it exists.
- `vasir add <skill> --replace` succeeds only when no local divergence remains.

## Alias Problems

Use this section for:

- `ALIAS_TARGET_MISSING`
- `ALIAS_CONFLICT`
- `ALIAS_REPAIR_FAILED`

Recommended path:

1. Inspect the conflicting alias path under `.claude`, `.codex`, or your home directory.
2. Move or delete the conflicting path if it is not meant to be the Vasir-managed alias.
3. Rerun `vasir init` for global aliases or `vasir add <skill>` for project-local aliases.

Verification:

- The alias resolves to the canonical `.agents` target.
- `realpath` on the alias path matches the target path.

## AGENTS Workflow Errors

Use this section for:

- `AGENTS_PROFILE_FLAG_VALUE_REQUIRED`
- `AGENTS_PROFILE_REQUIRED`
- `AGENTS_PROFILE_UNKNOWN`
- `AGENTS_FILE_EXISTS`
- `AGENTS_FILE_MISSING`
- `AGENTS_PURPOSE_PLACEHOLDER_MISSING`
- `AGENTS_PURPOSE_ALREADY_EDITED`
- `AGENTS_ROUTING_PLACEHOLDER_MISSING`
- `AGENTS_VALIDATION_FAILED`

Recommended path:

1. Preview with `vasir agents sync --dry-run`.
2. Run `vasir agents sync`.
3. If Vasir inferred the wrong profile, rerun with `vasir agents sync --profile backend`, `vasir agents sync --profile frontend`, `vasir agents sync --profile ios`, or `vasir agents sync --profile generic`.
4. Keep repo-specific landmines in `AGENTS__non-obvious.md`; `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are regenerated from it.
5. Use `vasir agents init`, `draft-purpose`, `draft-routing`, and `validate` only when you intentionally need the lower-level primitives.

Verification:

- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` exist at the repo root.
- Both generated contracts contain complete purpose and routing content; permanent composition markers remain in place.
- Any marked route exists and owns an explicitly required local `AGENTS.md`, or the route has been adjusted.
- Each rendered contract fits within 32 KiB. Move long workflow instructions into skills or scoped guidance if validation reports an oversized file.
- Generated twins agree on shared policy and profile guidance. If validation reports drift, inspect both changes, move intended project policy into the sidecar, and preview synchronization before applying it.

## Eval Errors

Use this section for:

- `EVAL_SUBCOMMAND_REQUIRED`
- `UNKNOWN_EVAL_SUBCOMMAND`
- `EVAL_SKILL_REQUIRED`
- `EVAL_SKILL_NOT_FOUND`
- `EVAL_SUITE_NOT_FOUND`
- `EVAL_SUITE_INVALID`
- `EVAL_SKILL_INVALID`
- `EVAL_MODELS_NOT_CONFIGURED`
- `EVAL_MODEL_DESCRIPTOR_INVALID`
- `EVAL_KEYS_INVALID`
- `MODEL_FLAG_VALUE_REQUIRED`
- `EVAL_PROVIDER_NOT_SUPPORTED`
- `EVAL_PROVIDER_AUTH_MISSING`
- `EVAL_PROVIDER_FAILED`
- `EVAL_PROVIDER_TIMEOUT`
- `EVAL_FETCH_UNAVAILABLE`
- `EVAL_CANCELLED`

Recommended path:

1. Start with the intended pit-of-success command: `vasir eval run <skill>`.
2. Confirm the skill exists locally under `.agents/skills/<skill>` or exists in the global catalog.
3. Confirm the skill owns a built-in suite at `.agents/skills/<skill>/evals/suite.json`.
4. Decide whether you want the default live models or an explicit override:
   - default run: `vasir eval run <skill>`
   - zero-cost smoke test: `vasir eval run <skill> --model mock`
   - explicit live override: `vasir eval run <skill> --model openai` or `--model opus`
   - faster single-sample run: `vasir eval run <skill> --trials 1`
5. If using live providers, prefer a repo-local `keys.json` using the documented [provider configuration](../cli/eval/provider-config.js), or confirm the matching provider credentials are set in the environment:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
6. If the terminal is interactive, rerun without `--json` and let Vasir prompt you to paste or skip a missing provider key.
7. If the report says `INCOMPLETE`, run `vasir eval inspect <skill> [run-id]` and inspect the saved `run.json` under `.agents/vasir-evals/<skill>/...`.
8. If the report says `hard checks only`, that means the suite is intentionally rules-only. If the suite defines `judgePrompt` and the fixed judges were unavailable, the hard-check section still renders but the top-line verdict should fail closed to `NO SIGNAL` unless the hard floor regressed. Rerun with both OpenAI and Anthropic credentials available if you need the full suite verdict.
9. Run `vasir eval inspect <skill>` to reopen the latest saved run and see the exact baseline/treatment outputs and judge reasons that moved the score.
10. If you changed the scorer logic, run `vasir eval rescore <skill>` before trusting an older saved summary.
11. If token totals show as unavailable, confirm you are running a live provider. `--model mock` does not report provider usage.
12. Rerun the eval and inspect the printed results directory under `.agents/vasir-evals/` if a partial run was written.

Verification:

- `vasir eval run <skill>` exits successfully.
- The command prints a results path under `.agents/vasir-evals/<skill>/...`.
- That directory contains `run.json`.

## Unexpected Errors

Use this section for:

- `UNEXPECTED_ERROR`

Recommended path:

1. Read the exact error text and the `suggestion` field.
2. Confirm whether the failure is environmental, such as an unexpected filesystem permission or shell setup issue.
3. Retry after fixing the local condition.
4. If the same failure reproduces, capture the command, full error, and your local directory layout before investigating the implementation.

Verification:

- The same command succeeds after the local issue is removed.
